170	H:	And at the time it was closed, two—I'll put it like this: GHS was not an accredited school at the time Lincoln was closed.							0.0

552	H:	It was no such thing that if a man, a student, disrespect a lady, a female student there, it was endorsed by the teachers; no, it was not endorsed by male nor female.							0.0
553	H:	No.							0.0
554	H:	That's the kind of teachers that we had at Lincoln.							0.0
555	W:	Any teachers in particular stand out as—?							0.0
556	H:	I will never forget Eunice Hightower.							0.0
557	H:	That was the teacher I was just talking about, the Home Economics teacher.							0.0
558	H:	I will never forget Jerry Miller.							0.0
559	H:	They were my favorite teachers.							0.0
560	H:	Jerry Miller, Eunice Hightower, Ms. Frederica Jones.							0.0
561	H:	She was my sponsor for three years: tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade.							0.0
562	H:	And Ms. Jones was the same way.							0.0
563	H:	"Men had to be men, and ladies had to be, females had to be ladies.							"							-1,-1,-1
564	H:	And that was the type of homeroom, group of homeroom students, that she required us being.							0
565	H:	And I really must say, I think one hundred percent of her students, of her homeroom, was that way.							0
566	W:	And what years were you at Lincoln?							0
567	H:	I came out at 65, must have come there, what, in 57?							0
568	H:	No, 59?							0
569	H:	59, something like that.							0
570	W:	Is there anything else you wish to add, that maybe I haven't asked, that you, something you'd just like to share?							0
571	H:	If a person didn't go to Lincoln, they missed a life teaching.							0
572	H:	Listen:							0
573	H:	I'm a Terrier.							0
574	H:	I'll never forget, the spirit of the terrier.							0
575	H:	And I carry that even though later on I became an Aggie.							0
576	H:	I'm just a Aggie-Terrier.							0
577	W:	Sounds like a great place to go to school.							0
578	H:	Yeah.							0
579	H:	It's a school that need to come back into existence.							0
580	H:	It needs to.							0
581	H:	And when I say that, I say that because of some of the problems that we are facing today in this society, especially with the African Americans.							0
582	H:	"If the environment of Lincoln could be recreated, it would help us tremendously.							"							-1
583	H:	It would help this country tremendously.							0
584	H:	It would help this city tremendously.							0
585	H:	This county.							0
586	W:	Do you ever think that will happen?							0
587	H:	Do I think it will happen?							0
588	H:	Dreams can come true if you believe it, and I do believe that that can happen.							0
589	H:	I believe that that should happen.							0
590	H:	"That that was a mistake made that can be corrected.							"							-1
591	W:	And now it's Lincoln Middle School?							0
592	H:	Now it's Lincoln Middle School							0
593	W:	But it's not the same.							0
594	H:	Even as a middle school, it's not like the junior high of Lincoln.							0
595	W:	So when Lincoln closed in 1970, what was the community's reaction?							0
596	H:	Everything that I know about it, is what I was told, because I wasn't—							0
597	W:	Because you weren't here, mmhm.							0
598	H:	Yeah, and they did not want it; I just don't think that the community put forth an effort to fight and maintain it.							0
599	H:	Because it could have been maintained.							0
600	H:	Because there were other cities that the same—when the federal government enforced integration in a lot of cities, a lot of those schools refused to close, and they did not close.							0
601	H:	They went without support, without money and stuff like that, but because they believed in themselves and believed in what they stood for, they didn't close.							0
602	H:	You see what I'm saying?							0
603	H:	And I think the same thing could have happened to Lincoln if the people would have believed in themselves a little bit more, been a little stronger than they were.							0
604	H:	They had a riot and all of that to show some certain appreciation, they reacted to it.							0
605	H:	But they didn't hold out long enough with what they were feeling.							0
606	H:	To me, they surrendered too soon.							0
607	H:	We talk about revolutionizing things, and revolutions, but what we fail to realize is that revolution means standing as that which you believe.							0
608	H:	And to, by all means, whatever means necessary, in order to make that change, you do it to make that change.							0
609	H:	And that was during the time of, if one would want to say there was a Black revolution going on, there was a Black revolution going on.							0
610	H:	But the people in this community, to me, didn't stand as firm as they could have stood, as far as the Black revolution was concerned.							0
611	H:	They accomplished a lot in other areas, but when it came to their education and their school, they gave in.							0
612	H:	Because I look at it like this: I can remember when they had the riot in Greensboro.							0
613	H:	The state had given the University of North Carolina, NC State, and a lot of the other predominantly White universities all this money for the next year, and gave A&T three hundred thousand dollars?							0
614	H:	No.							0
615	H:	We did not accept that.							0
616	H:	And, you know, we went to Raleigh, and we just stood firm.							0
617	H:	And regardless of what they said, how they said it, we just didn't give in to it.							0
618	H:	They ended up having to take all the money up and redistributing the money.							0
619	H:	And that was because we stood so firm.							0
620	H:	There were other Black state schools in the state of North Carolina that received even less than what we did.							0
621	H:	That couldn't buy a desk!							0
622	H:	And during the time that— you had to stand firm.							0
623	H:	I believe that when you stand firm, you get results.							0
624	H:	I have a friend who is a chairman of the history department at A&T today.							0
625	H:	Political Science department.							0
626	H:	When he was a senior in high school, he ran for president of his high school, Dudley, which was one of the schools that refused to close, during the days of integration.							0
627	H:	Enforcement of integration.							0
628	H:	"All right, he ran for president of his student body and the Superintendent didn't want him to be the president based on the fact that he was a member of YOBU/SOBU							"							-1
629	H:	And they wanted to look at it as an outlaw organization that created problems in the Black community, which was not so: it helped the Black community.							0
630	H:	It helped students.							0
631	H:	Okay?							0
632	H:	And he was not put on the ballot because the superintendent had ordered to the principal not to allow him to run for president of the student body.							0
633	H:	The students, knowing their rights, wrote in their ballot, their votes.							0
634	H:	And he won.							0
635	H:	So the next year, when it was time to install the officers, the students installed him, and the superintendent and the school board did not like that, and they didn't want that, and of course a riot broke out.							0
636	H:	"The students got very angry when they said he couldn't be president.							"							-1
637	H:	Then, college students got involved.							0
638	H:	The Panther party got involved.							0
639	H:	YOBU/SOBU got involved.							0
640	H:	Everybody got involved to say							0
641	H:	": ""This man qualifies to be the president,"" because academically, he qualified."							0
642	H:	You had to have a certain grade point average.							0
643	H:	And they stood.							0
644	H:	That was during the time when when one wanted to say Black revolution was going on.							0
645	H:	That was during that time, but the people in that community stood fast.							0
646	H:	"They stood as a group and refused; ""I shall not be moved."""							0
647	H:	So therefore, we went to jail.							0
648	H:	We had dogs put on us, water hoses, you know?							0
649	H:	I could remember when the riot in Greensboro started, which is, you know, got national attention.							0
650	H:	I was caught in the dormitory, and I went to jail.							0
651	H:	But I didn't care, because I was standing for something that I felt that was right; which here, oh man!							0
652	H:	It never would have worked that way.							0
653	W:	Do you wish you had been here when the—							0
654	H:	I wish I could have been here during that time, I really do.							0
655	H:	Because I think I would have had the same attitude about standing as I have now.							0
656	H:	"And I would have been one of the ones that would have refused to be quiet.							"							-1
657	H:	I'd have been voicing my opinion.							0
658	H:	I'd have been trying to organize.							0
659	H:	I'd have been trying to do a lot as far as maintaining Lincoln High School: a place that I had lived, many, many years, looked forward to, went there, felt that I had benefitted from it, and then you going to take it away, to say it no longer exists?							0
660	H:	I just don't feel like I would have just been one of the ones that sit back and just let it happen, saying, you know, don't want to get involved, don't want no trouble.							0
661	H:	Couldn't have felt that way.							0
662	H:	Couldn't have felt that way.							0
663	H:	There's one thing that I will say: being around those type of people that I was around in Greensboro, I don't regret it at all.							0
664	H:	"I think it helped me to be a strong soldier, as far as survival in this struggle, as far as this struggle is concerned.							"							-1
665	W:	When you were facing the dogs, and the water hoses, and being arrested, what did that make you feel like?							0
666	H:	Well, I knew that I was doing something that was worthwhile, that it was a good cause, and stuff like that.							0
667	H:	And sending a message, a positive message.							0
668	H:	I didn't care about it.							0
669	H:	You know, take me to jail.							0
670	H:	When I feel like, when I'm right, and you going to take me to jail because I'm right, take me to jail.							0
671	W:	How long did they hold you in jail?							0
672	H:	I think I was, I might have been in jail for about two or three days?							0
673	W:	What was that like?							0
674	H:	Oh, it was miserable, though!							0
675	H:	Because they ran out of space for the students, and there was like—  You know, it was just hard, it was just very difficult.							0
676	H:	But if I had to go through it again, I'd go through it.							0
677	W:	"So at no time when you were in jail you thought, ""I shouldn't have done this?"""							0
678	H:	No.							0
679	H:	"I was angry like a lot of the other ones that was angry that this society had to be so—could have so much ills about it.							"							-1
680	H:	"Wanted the changes to be made, because I knew it was good changes.							"							-1
681	H:	I wrote a play, and I based it on what I had learned about the sit-in demonstration, in order to teach behavior strategies to my cadets, called The Greensboro Four.							0
682	H:	And I taught them the play.							0
683	H:	And we performed the play, the play one time, at Metcalfe, and other than that, I just use it for behavioral teaching.							0
684	H:	"To let them know that regardless of what kind of pressure you might be under, something good can come out of it.							"							-1
685	H:	Something good came out of that.							0
686	H:	And that you don't have to pitch bricks, and throw rocks, and shoot 'em up bang-bang in order to get it done.							0
687	H:	Your weapon is this: your head, your mind, your brain.							0
688	H:	How to use it.							0
689	H:	Those are your bullets.							0
690	W:	Did you ever—with the play that you wrote, do you still use it as a teaching tool?							0
691	H:	From time to time.							0
692	H:	I was thinking about this summer, pulling it out and using it again, because I saw it helped some students, that are now juniors and seniors in high school.							0
693	H:	"And I was like, ""Hey I need to go back and do this again."							0
694	H:	""" Just to see that they maintain certain things, as far as not getting in trouble, knowing how to make decisions when you're angry, how to make the best decision, because sometimes we make wrong decisions when we angry."							0
695	H:	Out of anger, you can make a decision and it's the wrong choice, wrong decision.							0
696	W:	Not always thinking with a clear head.							0
697	H:	Yeah.							0
698	H:	I will say that that's what SOBU/YOBU taught me.							0
699	H:	Even when you're angry, you still got to have some common sense.							0
700	W:	Anything else you to add, maybe I haven't asked you something you want to share?							0
701	H:	I can't think of anything.							0
702	H:	Where I lived, what I lived for, what you just—							0
703	W:	So this neighborhood you grew up, I would assume it's changed a lot?							0
704	H:	Yeah, it's changed a lot.							0
705	W:	Anybody that you grew up with still live here?							0
706	H:	No.							0
707	W:	No?							0
708	H:	No.							0
709	H:	"There used to be houses back there.							"							-1
710	H:	They aren't there, as you see.							0
711	W:	Just empty lots now.							0
712	H:	Mmhm.							0
713	H:	And then, I can remember when there was a house back there.							0
714	H:	I just recently reunited with the family that, one of the families, the very first family we met when we moved over there, the Joneses.							0
715	H:	The family that lived behind us, I just recently reunited with them, you know, didn't think that they were nowhere around.							0
716	H:	Didn't ever know what happened to them after they moved out of the neighborhood.							0
717	H:	Well of course, down there, those houses down there don't stand anymore, there's a few of them.							0
718	H:	It's nobody else.							0
719	W:	And now you have a bank next door.							0
720	H:	Yeah, now we have a bank next door.							0
721	H:	"Before the bank, it used to be the Chevrolet Company here.							"							-1
722	H:	When I left, the post office was a grocery store, and this was a car dealership.							0
723	H:	We were sitting in the midst of a car dealership.							0
724	W:	Did the city every try to get you to move?							0
725	H:	Yeah they—no, not really.							0
726	H:	They hadn't really put any pressure on us about moving.							0
727	H:	The man that used owns, that used to own all of this land, Mr. Davis, he was always good about protecting others far as living was concerned.							0
728	H:	"There used to be a house next door.							"							-1
729	W:	"There used to be houses back here, where now it's all woods.							"							-1
730	W:	A lot of kids in the neighborhood?							0
731	H:	Oh yeah, this neighborhood had a lot of children in it.							0
732	H:	"Our backyard used to be so packed in the evening time, you would have thought you was at a recreation center.							"							-1
733	H:	But everybody was well-behaved.							0
734	H:	There was no fighting, or arguing.							0
735	H:	My grandmother didn't play that.							0
736	H:	And all of the kids in the neighborhood knew that; even though times were different then, children played together.							0
737	H:	They had their differences, they just had their differences.							0
738	H:	Parents didn't get into it to size up this, that, or the other.							0
739	H:	They just believed that you've got to get along.							0
740	H:	We were close-knitted neighborhood, children growing up.							0
741	H:	I just recently had one of my buddies from the neighborhood, to come and speak at Flossie McLendon Drill Team's banquet.							0
742	H:	He's the chairman of the—he the one that's the chairman of the business department at Bethune Cookman.							0
743	H:	He was from this neighborhood, and a lot of us did do pretty good.							0
744	H:	I mean, we didn't—. I'll put it like, we can produce, the ones that's from this neighborhood.							0
745	W:	Did he Lincoln as well?							0
746	H:	He went to Lincoln.							0
747	H:	Graduated in 66.							0
748	H:	Mmhm.							0
749	W:	So a year after you?							0
750	H:	A year after me, yeah, mmhm.							0
751	H:	There were other members, other people.							0
752	H:	I ain't go down that line and, you know, name people, tell you what they doing.							0
753	H:	"I'm just proud to be from this neighborhood.							"							-1
754	H:	But time separated us.							0
755	H:	Life, being  separated us.							0
756	H:	"But this was a good neighborhood, and it didn't have a reputation for bad kids at all—if it's any such a thing called ""bad kids."							0
757	H:	""" The adults in this neighborhood were, even though I was living here with my grandmother, I could be disciplined by someone down there, or from over here, or from over there, if I got off on the wrong track."							0
758	H:	See what I'm saying?							0
759	W:	Like community parenting.							0
760	H:	Yeah.							0
761	H:	Who was it, Hillary, that said it takes a—							0
762	W:	It takes a village.							0
763	H:	To raise a child.							0
764	W:	To raise a child.							0
765	H:	That's true.							0
766	H:	And I'm from this village.							0
767	H:	And it took this village to mold a lot of us, and we accept that.							0
768	W:	I think it worked.							0
769	H:	It worked.							0
770	H:	It worked.							0
771	W:	How did you guys get to school?							0
772	H:	We walked.							0
773	H:	They talk about busing, today.							0
774	H:	I walked from here to 7th Avenue many mornings in the rain, in the cold.							0
775	H:	Then, to get to Lincoln, which was real crazy, I used to have to walk from here to 7th, NW 7th Avenue, in order to go over in the Southeast side of town to Lincoln.							0
776	W:	That's not a—that's a long walk.							0
777	H:	"And then, they say, ""Well, okay, let's make it easy for them."							0
778	H:	""" I walk from here down to a place, a little store down there called Setzer's, it used to be called Setzer's."							0
779	H:	Now it's where the CVS is.							0
780	H:	Okay, and that was where we caught the bus in order to go to Lincoln.							0
781	H:	And then, who cared about busing and being bused?							0
782	H:	Some mornings, me and my friends, we would get together as a group and we would walk all the way to Lincoln.							0
783	H:	And didn't mind doing it.							0
784	H:	"And would be on time to school.							"							-1
785	W:	How long of a walk was that?							0
786	H:	From here to Waldo road, to where Lincoln Middle School is.							0
787	W:	That's a long distance!							0
788	H:	Yeah.							0
789	H:	Well, and then, too, it kept us in shape							0
790	H:	and then we didn't mind doing that.							0
791	H:	Because if you played football, or if you was in the band, that was an afterschool thing, so you had to walk home anyway.							0
792	W:	No buses were running after school?							0
793	H:	No buses were running after school.							0
794	W:	Were these school buses or were they city buses?							0
795	H:	School buses.							0
796	H:	Remember, we haven't always rode the city buses.							0
797	W:	You couldn't ride the bus back then?							0
798	H:	I done forgot when the bus system was integrated, but we never really wanted to ride the city bus as children.							0
799	H:	Maybe the adults did, but I can't remember as a child wanting to ride the city bus, or having to ride the bus to do things.							0
800	H:	I had a bicycle, and in the seventh grade I enjoyed riding my bike to school.							0
801	H:	So that's how I got to school in the seventh grade over at Lincoln.							0
802	H:	I rode my bike to school.							0
803	H:	So busing, this thing about busing and stuff, like, never was appealing to me, because it was always crazy, except when they moved it to Setzer's.							0
804	H:	Want to ride the bus to Setzer's.							0
805	H:	Nothing was wrong with walking from here to where CVS is to catch the bus.							0
806	H:	Nothing was wrong with that.							0
807	H:	But to walk from here to A Quinn Jones, to catch the bus, to go over here; that was crazy to me.							0
808	H:	Didn't make sense.							0
809	H:	But I did it, because that was what it called for.							0
810	W:	Were there any other high schools in the area that you could've gone to, or was Lincoln the option at the time?							0
811	H:	Lincoln was the only place I could go because I was Black.							0
812	H:	The first African Americans didn't go to GHS until 1965.							0
813	W:	Wow.							0
814	W:	It's definitely a long way to go school, but, it was a place worth going to.							0
815	H:	Yeah and that was nothing, because look at people that lived in Fairbanks: they had to come all the way from Fairbanks over here.							0
816	H:	From Archer.							0
817	W:	How many people were in your graduating class?							0
818	W:	How many kids?							0
819	H:	My graduating class?							0
820	W:	"They had to be about a hundred and thirty five, somewhere like that.							"							-1
821	W:	So, pretty small class.							0
822	H:	Pretty small.							0
823	H:	Compared to—well, it was probably one of the largest classes that came out of Lincoln during that time.							0
824	H:	But after then, the classes were bigger than that.							0
825	W:	Most kids finish, or how was the?							0
826	H:	Yeah, most kids finished.							0
827	H:	I don't think the dropout rates was high at all at Lincoln.							0
828	H:	Back in them days, you didn't drop out of school.							0
829	H:	And you wasn't put out of school like they do now.							0
830	H:	Or to say you can't go back to school in Alachua County anymore, anywhere.							0
831	H:	You know, it wasn't like that then.							0
832	H:	So the dropout rate was no outstanding rate.							0
833	H:	You went to school.							0
834	H:	And then you have to think about the fact that young people, it wasn't that many young people in Gainesville at the time.							0
835	H:	So going to school, the population of Blacks wasn't as great as it is now.							0
836	H:	Lincoln would probably now, I'd say, have classes of four and five hundred students to graduate, if it was still around.							0
837	W:	Maybe it will come back.							0
838	H:	Let's hope so.							0
839	H:	Let's hope so.							0
840	H:	As Lincoln, a school that would serve the community.							0
841	H:	As Lincoln.							0
842	W:	Is there anything else you wish to add?							0
843	H:	No, no.							0
