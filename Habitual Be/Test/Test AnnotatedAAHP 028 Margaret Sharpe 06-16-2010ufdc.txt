620	S:	I started in Rochelle, and she was my first grade teacher, Miss Parker.							0
621	S:	She was very good.							0
622	S:	She—we learned a lot.							0
623	S:	Because like, you know, you had first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth grade, and then seventh and eighth.							0
624	S:	We had a little three-room school.							0
625	S:	We had like first grade.							0
626	S:	Because we didn't have kindergarten.							0
627	S:	Like they have kindergarten?							0
628	S:	We didn't have kindergarten—we just started the school in first grade.							0
629	S:	First—							0
630	S:	yeah.							0
631	S:	First, second, third, and fourth, fifth and sixth; then seventh and eighth were in the little room.							0
632	S:	But Lincoln was—I really did like it because—in Home Ec, we learned to sew, and we learned to cook.							0
633	S:	And then we would put on the show for, you know, to model our garments that we did for sewing.							0
634	L:	Oh, a fashion show?							0
635	S:	Yes.							0
636	L:	Oh, wow.							0
637	S:	And then in cooking, it was very nice too; both teachers were very good.							0
638	S:	And would you believe both of them were in my wedding?							0
639	L:	Really?							0
640	S:	Both of my Home Economics teachers was in my wedding.							0
641	S:	Yes.							0
642	S:	Yes.							0
643	L:	Oh, wow.							0
644	S:	One of them played for the other one to sing.							0
645	S:	But for cooking, we had to do a complete meal.							0
646	S:	And with us, greens or cabbage was mostly the type of vegetable that she wouldn't let us do it.							0
647	S:	"She wouldn't let us—she says, """							0
648	S:	And we're not fixing any greens today.							0
649	S:	And you're not fixing any cabbage.							0
650	S:	""" I say to myself, ""How in the world is she not going to let us do something that we really know about?"							0
651	S:	""" We had to fix something different, like broccoli."							0
652	S:	And cauliflower.							0
653	S:	I think she let us did string beans, because for most of us didn't—for me, I didn't like anything with a hull on it.							0
654	S:	I mean, and then we had to invite two of our instructors for dinner.							0
655	S:	Once we prepared it, fixed it and everything, we had to invite them.							0
656	S:	And here, she's sitting over here, grading you.							0
657	L:	Oh, no pressure!							0
658	S:	To see how——how well you do.							0
659	S:	Did you use your silverware correctly?							0
660	S:	Oh, we had to do all the etiquette.							0
661	S:	And we had to do that.							0
662	L:	And was this at home or was this—?							0
663	S:	No, this was at school!							0
664	L:	At school?							0
665	S:	At school.							0
666	S:	The classroom was large enough for us to cook in it, and we prepared the food in the classroom.							0
667	S:	Then, we had to invite two—a man and a woman—to, you know, each one of us, it was like maybe five or six to the group; and you had to invite two teachers, a man and a woman, to come and critique you—see how, was it enjoyable?							0
668	S:	Whatever, you know.							0
669	S:	And then, they would tell her.							0
670	S:	Although, she was sitting there to make sure: did you serve to your right?							0
671	S:	You know?							0
672	S:	We had to do all of that.							0
673	S:	And I was the captain of my team.							0
674	S:	And we had played like a—learning what we was doing, we did it like a baseball game.							0
675	S:	She'll ask you the questions and whether, if you could answer it, then you could move to first base.							0
676	S:	If you couldn't, you was out.							0
677	S:	Then, somebody else would at.							0
678	S:	But that's how we learned, and it really stuck with you, how you did, and to do that.							0
679	S:	We had PE every day, and we had to dress up.							0
680	S:	We had to have uniform: white shirts, white shorts, white socks, white tennis shoes.							0
681	L: %HB 	"And they better be nice and ironed every day.							"							1
682	S:	Every day.							0
683	L:	"You better have your stuff, and those tennis shoes better be nice and white.							"							-1
684	S:	Like, I see kids, they—we couldn't do that.							0
685	S:	"When she said, ""Dress out in your uniform,"" you had to dress out!"							0
686	S:	And I mean—and she's going to inspect you when you come back.							0
687	L:	The PE teacher?							0
688	S:	Teacher, yes.							0
689	S:	Yes, to make sure.							0
690	S:	And if something was out of place or something, she'd—							0
691	L:	Call you out.							0
692	S:	But it was good.							0
693	S:	It was a good experience.							0
694	S:	I really did—I enjoyed all of my teachers, because they were all very nice to me.							0
695	S:	Because I made sure I was very nice.							0
696	S:	You know, not getting into any trouble or anything.							0
697	S:	Because my grandmother would've killed me if I had.							0
698	S:	But it was all nice.							0
699	S:	We had men and women.							0
700	S:	Because my eleventh grade history teacher was a man, Mr. Bob Jones.							0
701	S:	And he loved—what is that?							0
702	S:	Baseball.							0
703	S:	"When we coming up, and the guys would get together to watch the baseball, and sometimes he'll says, ""Now Margaret, you're over the class today, and you make sure everybody turn in their homeworks."""							0
704	S:	"""Me?"							0
705	S:	"Why does he get me to do it?"""							0
706	S:	"He says, ""And I expect to see this on my desk when I return."""							0
707	S:	"As soon as he leave the room, I said, ""Now, you know we were supposed to bring this homework in."							0
708	S:	So, everybody have it, put it up there.							0
709	S:	"I'm not going to check to see did you put it there, but just make sure you put your homework up,"" I said, ""because I'm going to put mine there."							0
710	S:	"So if you didn't do yours, you got time to do it now."""							0
711	L:	Right?							0
712	S:	"""You better try to get it done,"" I say, ""because you know Mr. Jones don't play."							0
713	S:	"He be saying""—I say, ""because the next time, it'll be somebody else he'll call on."""							0
714	S:	Because that's the way he would do; he'd call on not the same person every time.							0
715	S:	You'd never know who he was going call on, but—							0
716	L:	To collect all the homework?							0
717	S:	To collect that homework.							0
718	S:	And they'd better turn it in, too.							0
719	L:	Why would he make the students collect it?							0
720	S:	Well, he just, I think—I don't know.							0
721	S:	I was just—I never did really understand that, why he would do that.							0
722	S:	"But I know that the biggest time it would be during the time that the baseball game would be coming on.							"							-1,-1
723	L:	Oh, because he wants to—.							0
724	S:	And you didn't watch it on TV, they'd go somewhere.							0
725	S:	Like they having a conference, but they would have that.							0
726	S:	That's my granddaughter.							0
727	S:	She works for the county, city, or somebody.							0
728	L:	Do you need me to—should I turn this off for a second?							0
729	L:	I do want to kind of ask a couple of questions just to follow up.							0
730	S:	Okay.							0
731	L:	You had mentioned about that first math teacher—or, that first math class that you had when you went to Santa Fe.							0
732	S:	I can't think of his name, but it was really good.							0
733	S:	I mean, he was really—a really good teacher.							0
734	L:	And he was a White educator?							0
735	L:	He was a White professor?							0
736	S:	Yes, he was a White professor, and he was really good.							0
737	S:	I mean, he seemed like he—because I knew I was the oldest one in the class.							0
738	L:	Because you had just come, you like raised your kids, going back to school in the 70s.							0
739	S:	And he treated me really nice, you know what I'm saying?							0
740	S:	And that really was my first class—first time being, going to school with mixed kids.							0
741	S:	I'd never had gone to school with a mixed group.							0
742	S:	Because when I went to Florida A&M, it was all Black.							0
743	S:	Now, they got Whites going there now.							0
744	S:	But it wasn't when I was attending, back in 53. 1953.							0
745	S:	No.							0
746	S:	It was all Black.							0
747	L:	Now is—I mean, was that your, going in, and that was your first experience—I mean outside of the classroom, were there any other—was it hard to get along?							0
748	S:	You know, after that, I didn't really have any problems.							0
749	S:	I guess he sort of set the atmosphere straight, and even from then on—you know how some of them do drop and add and everything, but most of them were still there, and they treated me fine after then.							0
750	S:	It was no problem after that.							0
751	S:	And one guy, I see he became a lawyer.							0
752	S:	I know—the Black guy, he became a lawyer.							0
753	S:	And from then on, I didn't have any problem until I got to, let's see, what was—the nursing class.							0
754	S:	Ms. something.							0
755	S:	Because when I started nursing, I had all the, what you call—one part is the theory, and the other part clinical.							0
756	S:	I had clinical down pat.							0
757	S:	Yes, really!							0
758	S:	Because I worked in a doctor's office.							0
759	S:	I went to there to just work for two weeks, but the person that they had there, she had to have a major operation, and she was gone for nine months.							0
760	S:	So I stayed there the whole time, and they said everybody that would come to relieve her for vacation time, they didn't learn nothing.							0
761	S:	They—you know—but I learned a whole lot, because I was interested; I wanted to learn.							0
762	S:	And I had worked to AGH, and they had the annex.							0
763	S:	See, before integration, now, I worked at AGH And AGH had a wing off of here which they called the Annex, and that's where the Black patients were.							0
764	S:	Peds, OB/GYN, everything.							0
765	S:	So, I worked that wing.							0
766	S:	So you know, you had to do it all, to learn it all.							0
767	S:	And I bet you I delivered more babies.							0
768	L:	Really?							0
769	S:	Yes!							0
770	S:	"Because, like, they would come in and say, ""Well, I've been carrying this child for nine months, and its coming."""							0
771	S:	And the supervisor, she always had that little emergency kit there for you to do, and she carried you through all of this stuff just in case she can't get there in time.							0
772	S:	So you got to catch the baby or something.							0
773	L:	And so, this was in the annex, right there.							0
774	L:	Baby—like, they just come in?							0
775	S:	Yeah, because they didn't get to go up to third floor, up to the delivery room.							0
776	S:	Sometimes they didn't make it to the delivery room.							0
777	L:	It was a delivery room for Whites only, or was that just they couldn't get in there in time?							0
778	S:	No.							0
779	S:	Yeah,							0
780	S:	yeah,							0
781	S:	yeah, because you—we had a doctor: Dr. Banks.							0
782	S:	He was Black.							0
783	S:	And some of the doctors were White.							0
784	S:	But they could take you up to the delivery room to deliver, but then they brought you back to the annex.							0
785	L:	Because you weren't—you could use the facilities, and then right back?							0
786	S:	"That was what they had for you to be.							"							-1
787	S:	Surgery, OB/GYN, whatever, Peds.							0
788	S:	Peds was, like, in the hallway, and you had like a ward for the women, and the men on one side.							0
789	S:	And these couple—you had a room for isolation, then you had the couple of rooms that was like for OB/GYN Then you had the little Peds' nursery, for the little newborn babies.							0
790	S:	Yep.							0
791	S:	I'm been through it, so.							0
792	L:	And that was even before you were even going to Santa Fe for nursing.							0
793	L:	You were in there volunteering.							0
794	L:	When was that?							0
795	L:	How old were you?							0
796	S:	Oh, no, no.							0
797	S:	Well, 58. 1958.							0
798	S:	Because see, I had finished school, and I was there.							0
799	S:	1958, I got a job at Alachua General.							0
800	L:	Wow.							0
801	L:	And how long did you work there for?							0
802	S:	Well, I left there in 1960, 61, and went to the big Shands.							0
803	S:	And I worked— because I was doing so good, the supervisor wanted me to work in the ER							0
804	S:	"And I say, ""You think I can do—?"""							0
805	S:	"She say, ""Oh, yes!"							0
806	S:	You can do it.							0
807	S:	I know you can do it.							0
808	S:	""" I say, ""Okay, whatever you say."""							0
809	S:	So I got a lot of experience, so I had a lot of clinical stuff when I went to school.							0
810	S:	So I wasn't worried about being able to do the clinical part.							0
811	S:	It was just the theory.							0
812	S:	"And so, she told me—I think her name was Ms. Benson or something like that—but anyway, she says, ""You might as well do something."""							0
813	S:	"I said, ""Well if you want me to do the theory, I might as well do the whole class."							0
814	S:	I'm in no big hurry.							0
815	S:	"I might as well do the whole thing."""							0
816	S:	So when I did the whole thing over, I got a B in the theory part, and I got a A in the clinical.							0
817	L:	"I knew it wasn't going be no problem doing that—I mean, I had it down pat.							"							-1
818	S:	Because all of them other kids, they didn't want to do too much.							0
819	L:	"And every time we'd go to the hospital to do something, and it'd be time for one of those White kids to do it, I always ended up having to do it.							"							-1
820	S:	"Because the instructors didn't want to be—they had people coming in to watch, you know, to see.							"							-1
821	S:	And I loved Dr. Gilliland.							0
822	S:	"He say, ""You know what?"							0
823	S:	You a great student.							0
824	S:	""" Because he'd examine a patient, and then he'd have me to do it, and I'm telling him everything that was going on."							0
825	S:	"He says, ""That's the same thing that I felt."							0
826	S:	"The same thing""— whatever I was telling him, he says, ""You'll make a great nurse."""							0
827	L:	Dr. Gilliland?							0
828	L:	And that was at Shands?							0
829	S:	That was AGH							0
830	S:	He was a OB/GYN							0
831	L:	Is that where you, like when you did nursing, you were more OB/GYN?							0
832	L:	Like that's where you—you worked in that area?							0
833	S:	No!							0
834	S:	I did the whole thing.							0
835	L:	All of it?							0
836	S:	All of it.							0
837	L:	The ER, everything.							0
838	S:	Everything.							0
839	S:	All of it.							0
840	S:	When I went to the big Shands, that's when I worked surgical intensive care.							0
841	S:	Recovering surgical intensive care.							0
842	S:	And we had everything: before Shands decide to make a medical ICU and a Peds ICU, we had everybody in Surgical ICU							0
843	L:	All together.							0
844	S:	Everybody.							0
845	S:	We had Peds, we had the surgical patient, we had the medical patients.							0
846	L:	"Everybody was down there, and sometimes it would be me and the supervisor.							"							-1
847	S:	Boy, I'm telling you!							0
848	S:	But I enjoyed it.							0
849	S:	It was really good.							0
850	S:	"And I kept saying, ""This is exactly what, I'm going to be nurse."							0
851	S:	"I'm going to be a nurse if it kills me!"""							0
852	S:	And that's what I ended up becoming.							0
853	L:	Wow, nice to have that passion.							0
854	L:	That's so cool—and then you do it, and—wow.							0
855	S:	Yes, I loved it.							0
856	S:	"And you know, different people will ask other people, ""Have you seen—you know who I'm talking about!"""							0
857	S:	"""I wish, I would like for her to take care of my mother."""							0
858	S:	"""I would like for her to take care of my dad."""							0
859	S:	"""Oh, I need her, I need her."""							0
860	S:	"I says, ""I'm not doing that anymore."""							0
861	S:	Because then my family, my elders, you know started getting ill, and I had to see about them, take care of them and see about it.							0
862	S:	So, I didn't do it anymore.							0
863	S:	But like I said, Lincoln High, I wouldn't trade it for anything else.							0
864	S:	I loved Lincoln!							0
865	S:	And the University of Florida?							0
866	S:	We used to have a parade and everything, and we had a band and all.							0
867	S:	And after the University of Florida would have their parade, we would get a lot of their stuff and do our floats and things.							0
868	L:	A parade for a game day?							0
869	S:	Yes!							0
870	S:	Yes, when we was getting ready to have our Homecoming.							0
871	S:	Mmhm.							0
872	S:	Yeah, the University of Florida.							0
873	S:	We used to do that, and that was—it was so nice.							0
874	L:	Did everyone come out, the whole community?							0
875	S:	Yes, yes.							0
876	S:	And it was just really nice, really, really nice.							0
877	S:	And we had the—like I said, and I made my evening dress for the spring festival.							0
878	S:	I made my evening dress for the prom.							0
879	S:	Because I was taking sewing in Home Ec.							0
880	L:	And you would do that with the fashion show?							0
881	S:	Yes!							0
882	S:	Yes!							0
883	S:	It was really, really nice.							0
884	S:	"And it would be nice to see everybody get all dressed up; the guys would be in their suits, and then they'd bring their corsages and everything.							"							-1,-1
885	S:	It was really nice.							0
886	S:	I wouldn't trade that experience for anything else.							0
887	S:	I really did enjoy Lincoln.							0
888	S:	But I'm glad that it became integrated where each child—whether you Black, White, Chinese, Japanese, whatever—you have the same chance that the others have to get an education, a good education.							0
889	S:	If you apply yourself, you can do well.							0
890	S:	"You just have to be able to apply yourself.							"							-1
891	L:	So, how did you feel when it integrated, and then it ended up closing?							0
892	S:	About Lincoln closing?							0
893	S:	Yeah, that's what we've been talking about.							0
894	L:	"We was trying to figure a way that we could get Lincoln High School back, but it'll never be the same.							"							-1
895	L:	"It'll never—it will never be the same.							"							-1
896	S:	Because they have destroyed so much of our memorabilia, like all the awards and things that the school received; trophies and different things.							0
897	L:	They destroyed it?							0
898	L:	Who?							0
899	S:	I understand they moved a lot of it out of the new Lincoln, and put it in the basement, and then a lot of it just ended up in the fire.							0
900	S:	So—							0
901	L:	What, a fire?							0
902	S:	Fire.							0
903	S:	You know, they just got rid of it.							0
904	L:	They burned it?							0
905	S:	They burned it,							0
906	S:	yeah.							0
907	L:	Wow, why?							0
908	L:	That's horrible.							0
909	S:	"It is, and that's the reason I says it'll never be the same.							"							-1
910	S:	"It'll never be the same.							"							-1
911	S:	Because when it went to new Lincoln, I know we had our fiftieth—no, we had— because our class was the first that we remembered having a class reunion, and we gave them one of these big cabinets where you could put the trophies in and lock it.							0
912	S:	I haven't seen it since we gave it to them, and we put it at the new Lincoln.							0
913	S:	And it was to put the trophies that the guys, that they had won for basketball, and the ones for football.							0
914	L:	From when you went to school?							0
915	S:	Uh-huh.							0
916	S:	It was all destroyed as far as—that's what they were talking about when we was planning this Lincoln reunion that we just did.							0
917	S:	And they say one or two people have some things from Lincoln, but that's a—because my sister, she was Miss Lincoln in 51, and we didn't take any pictures.							0
918	S:	And I went							0
919	S:	and I asked to see if they—and I know pictures were taken and everything, but—I can just see her in that convertible with her red and white on.							0
920	S:	And she loved tams, and she had a tam.							0
921	L:	A tam, what's that?							0
922	S:	The little tam that you sit on your head.							0
923	L:	Oh, okay.							0
924	S:	Uh-huh.							0
925	S:	And she was in the middle, and two of her attendants—one was on each side of her—but, as I said, we didn't take a picture.							0
926	S:	So, I didn't have one.							0
927	S:	When they was doing this, well I did have her graduation picture, but I didn't have a picture of them being on the float.							0
928	L:	And that's such a shame, because you think about how great it was, and you talk about all of these things, like with the community and stuff, and it's such a legacy, and such positive contribution.							0
929	S:	Yes, it was.							0
930	S:	It was.							0
931	L:	And then just, they take that.							0
932	L:	And it's almost—							0
933	S:	Yes.							0
934	S:	"So like I told them, I says, ""It'll never be the same, even if you got the name back, because you'll never have a complete Black school."							0
935	S:	"It's not going to be that way, because you have to go with the way it's zoned off.							"							-1
936	S:	"So it never would, you know, be."""							0
937	S:	"So, I think that's why instead of naming it ""Lincoln,"" they named it Eastside, and Buchholz."							0
938	S:	That way, when they built the school that would— Buchholz.							0
939	S:	GHS kept its name, because it was right there where the 720 building is.							0
940	S:	You know where the 720—the plaza?							0
941	L:	Okay.							0
942	S:	720?							0
943	S:	Okay.							0
944	S:	Well, that was GHS school; then Santa Fe, that's where I started going there.							0
945	S:	Because GHS had moved where they are now.							0
946	L:	Right.							0
947	L:	So you still go to the—you just had the reunion?							0
948	S:	Yeah, we just had our biannual class reunion, and it was nice.							0
949	S:	Quite a few people attended; a lot of them was from out of town.							0
950	S:	You can't hardly get the people right here in town to do anything.							0
951	S:	Three of our classmates that graduated in 1950 was there.							0
952	S:	Our Miss Lincoln, and that was the first year that the whole school voted— all before each class raised the money, say tenth, eleventh, and twelfth.							0
953	L:	"They raised, and which class raised the most money would have the student would be Miss Lincoln.							"							-1
954	S:	But the class of 1950, the whole school voted on her and my class won.							0
955	S:	She was Miss Lincoln.							0
956	L:	"And ""Miss Lincoln,"" what was ""Miss Lincoln?"""							0
957	S:	She was the girl that represented the whole entire school.							0
958	L:	Wow.							0
959	S:	Yeah, she was.							0
960	S:	The whole school, and we had the whole school from first grade to vote.							0
961	L:	Everyone.							0
962	S:	And we really sold our class, and we got all the votes, really.							0
963	L:	"So who could have been—anyone could've been ""Miss Lincoln,"" or was it the older girls?"							0
964	S:	Tenth through twelfth.							0
965	S:	"And seventh through ninth was, like, ""Miss Homecoming."""							0
966	L:	Okay.							0
967	L:	So it was kind of like a tiered thing.							0
968	L:	"But ""Miss Lincoln"" was ""Miss Lincoln."""							0
969	S:	"Yes, yes. """							0
970	S:	"Miss Lincoln"" was ""Miss Lincoln,"" and so, we felt like we start that trend and have the whole school to vote on."							0
971	S:	So anybody from tenth through twelfth, whoever you chose to run out of your class, could win.							0
972	L:	So was it like a Homecoming—was that for Homecoming week?							0
973	L:	And they would go out and that was part of the whole parade, with the convertibles and stuff?							0
974	S:	Yes, she was the queen, then she had her attendant.							0
975	S:	"Some of her attendants would be the class, you know, whoever first runner-up, second runner-up, whatever.							"							-1
976	S:	You know, that's the way it was.							0
977	S:	It was very nice.							0
978	S:	I mean, I always think about those days.							0
979	S:	Because my first year, I was in the drill team, and we had to wear red and white.							0
980	S:	And red skirt, white shirt, waist blouse, , white socks.							0
981	S:	And we had a band—Mr. Miller was our band teacher.							0
982	S:	He just had come from FAMU, and he started the band.							0
983	S:	And then, when they went to Eastside, all of the band went with him.							0
984	S:	I'm so sick they don't have a band!							0
985	S:	I guess—							0
986	L:	Lincoln lost the band?							0
987	S:	Eastside didn't have a band anymore.							0
988	S:	"But when they did split up, all the kids that went there was in the band, and so after all of that group of people left—because my son, he used to be with the drummers.							"							-1
989	S:	They was patterning themselves after FAMU band.							0
990	S:	They was just about as good as they were.							0
991	L:	Wow.							0
992	S:	They sure were!							0
993	L:	The drum line is the best part.							0
994	S:	They was really great!							0
995	S:	But then they tell me they don't have a band anymore at Eastside.							0
996	S:	I guess parents, with the economy—most of the kids owned their own instruments.							0
997	S:	Their parents decided to get them, and they didn't relinquish them when they graduated; they just kept their—because I know my granddaughter, she was in the band at Westwood Middle.							0
998	S:	She didn't get rid of her—							0
999	L:	Instrument?							0
1000	S:	"I say, ""Well you could've—."" ""No, that's mine."							0
1001	S:	"You bought it for me."""							0
1002	S:	So she has it in Spartanburg with her now!							0
1003	S:	So that was really a great experience at Lincoln.							0
1004	S:	I mean, I really loved every minute of it.							0
1005	S:	It was really, really nice.							0
1006	S:	The only thing I really didn't like was the food.							0
1007	L:	The food?							0
1008	S:	For lunch.							0
1009	S:	I didn't like that food!							0
1010	S:	I don't know, I just couldn't get used to it.							0
1011	S:	"So I told my grandmother, I says, ""I have to take my lunch."							0
1012	S:	I'll just buy some milk.							0
1013	S:	""""							0
1014	S:	And that's what I did.							0
1015	L:	What was the food like?							0
1016	S:	It just—I don't know, it just didn't taste like the food I was used to eating.							0
1017	S:	And, I don't know—and I told her I just couldn't digest it.							0
1018	L:	Where were the Home Ec teachers?							0
1019	S:	"""I just can't,"" I says, ""I just can't!"""							0
1020	S:	And every day, I'd stop at that little store and buy me a nice big red apple.							0
1021	S:	"It would only be like a dime.							"							-1
1022	S:	"And I says, ""I'll have to make it on this apple."							0
1023	S:	Because I just cannot eat that food.							0
1024	S:	""" I tried it, but I just couldn't."							0
1025	S:	And so, I took my lunch every day.							0
1026	S:	I brought my lunch to school every day, but I'd go in the lunchroom and buy milk to drink.							0
1027	S:	Because that's one thing they insisted on you having: milk.							0
1028	S:	Every day.							0
1029	S:	They insisted on the children, making sure they had milk.							0
1030	S:	"They kept saying, ""It's good for your teeth, it's good for your health, your bones, and everything."							0
1031	S:	You need to drink your milk.							0
1032	S:	"You need to drink your milk."""							0
1033	S:	"""Okay."							0
1034	S:	""" We'd drink."							0
1035	S:	"And they wanted to instill on you: ""Eat your carrots!"""							0
1036	S:	And I couldn't stand carrots.							0
1037	S:	No, no no.							0
1038	S:	"I says, ""Not me and those carrots!"""							0
1039	S:	Mm-mm.							0
1040	L:	I'd like an extra apple!							0
1041	S:	"I just won't have—my eyesight just will not be good if I have to eat carrots for it.							"							-1
1042	S:	So, I didn't.							0
1043	S:	But other than that, we had some wonderful teachers.							0
1044	S:	And I sang in the glee club there.							0
1045	S:	Ms. Johnson was a sweetheart.							0
1046	L:	So how many extracurricular activities—you did glee club, baseball?							0
1047	L:	Basketball.							0
1048	S:	Basketball.							0
1049	L:	Drill team.							0
1050	S:	Drill team, yep.							0
1051	S:	I did that because I loved that.							0
1052	S:	"I just wanted to be a part of something, and you could choose what you'd like to be—participate in.							"							-1,-1
1053	S:	And I loved the singing in the glee club.							0
1054	S:	It was nice.							0
1055	S:	And we'd go to Ms. Johnson's house on Sunday afternoon and practice.							0
1056	S:	My grandmother would take me; bring me over there to practice.							0
1057	S:	It was really nice.							0
1058	S:	Like I said, I wouldn't change that experience for anything.							0
1059	S:	I loved Lincoln.							0
1060	S:	I wish it could have stayed on, but changes do come.							0
1061	L:	Yeah.							0
1062	S:	Yeah.							0
1063	S:	So.							0
1064	S:	And sometimes it's for the better.							0
1065	S:	"And I have to say now it was for the better, because our kids couldn't come up: ""I just didn't know that."							0
1066	S:	I couldn't do that.							0
1067	S:	I didn't get that.							0
1068	S:	""" You had the same chance Anne over there had, so why you couldn't do it?"							0
1069	S:	Because you didn't apply yourself.							0
1070	S:	And so my kids, they couldn't tell me that.							0
1071	S:	"I would say, ""Well, whatever you all needed""—something."							0
1072	S:	"I says, ""I know you wasn't going be able to go and study in the library as long as you want."							0
1073	S:	""" That's why I made sure I got the set of encyclopedias, so they'd have it there, that they could look up stuff to learn and everything."							0
1074	L:	To really give them every opportunity.							0
1075	S:	Yes!							0
1076	S:	Yes.							0
1077	S:	And they had it so they couldn't say they didn't, because practically the whole neighborhood used my books.							0
1078	S:	"I've got some missing now because when I came here, ""Can I borrow your book?"""							0
1079	S:	And then they never bring it back, and I forget who got it, taken it.							0
1080	S:	"But everybody's out and that granddaughter , she says, ""Granny, I've already got a set for my kids."							0
1081	S:	""" I said, ""Good."							0
1082	S:	Then I don't have to worry about any more kids.							0
1083	S:	"You already got a set."""							0
1084	S:	"And I says, ""If you don't have the Childcraft, you can take the Childcraft with you."							0
1085	S:	"Because it won't be any more children!							"							-1
1086	S:	So, you can take those with you when you get ready to go.							0
1087	L:	Yeah.							0
1088	S:	Yeah.							0
1089	S:	Anything else?							0
1090	L:	No, I mean, is there anything you want to add, anything for the record?							0
1091	S:	Oh, let's see.							0
1092	L:	Any favorite memories, or just last thoughts?							0
1093	S:	No.							0
1094	S:	Because now, like the kids are going to Washington for the patrols and things.							0
1095	S:	We didn't have that.							0
1096	S:	I don't even remember them saying anything about it, but—							0
1097	L:	At the patrols?							0
1098	S:	We didn't have any patrols at our school, during the time back then.							0
1099	S:	We didn't have that.							0
1100	S:	But I'm trying to think of something.							0
1101	S:	I'm trying to think of something that we might've done.							0
1102	S:	The only thing I know, we always had that rivalry with AL Mebane in Alachua.							0
1103	S:	It was a high school there; it was a high school in , it was a high school in Shell, Alachua—maybe it was High Springs.							0
1104	S:	I'm not sure.							0
1105	S:	Marion County.							0
1106	L:	Marion?							0
1107	S:	Yeah, we used to play them too—football.							0
1108	S:	And it was good.							0
1109	S:	You know, the teams was really good.							0
1110	S:	We used to play Starke, too, but they always wanted to fight or do something.							0
1111	S:	I remember this semi hit the light pole, and everything went out.							0
1112	S:	And then the people, they just start throwing eggs at the bus.							0
1113	S:	And Mr. Parker was the music teacher, band teacher; he got them kids on that bus, and he left.							0
1114	S:	"I said, ""I can't leave my son and my neighbor's children; they expecting me!"""							0
1115	S:	"I say, ""And the coach is not letting them go!"							0
1116	S:	Oh, no.							0
1117	S:	"I can't leave them up here too; I got to stay here right with them."""							0
1118	L:	"Because I had to make sure they'd be safe and everything.							"							-1
1119	S:	So finally, they came back							0
1120	S:	and we beat them!							0
1121	S:	They finally got the lights back, and we beat 'em!							0
1122	S:	I mean, we really did.							0
1123	S:	But like I say, the teachers were really nice.							0
1124	S:	And to say that we had the young men that came back from the Service and went to school, and how respectful they were to their teachers and things.							0
1125	S:	I remember Mr. T B McPherson when we was marching.							0
1126	L:	What was his name?							0
1127	S:	TB McPherson.							0
1128	L:	Oh, TB McPherson.							0
1129	L:	Okay.							0
1130	S:	Uh-huh.							0
1131	S:	When we were marching, and practically the boys—they was just about all six feet or more, and he just started crying.							0
1132	S:	"He said, ""There go my whole football team!"							0
1133	S:	"Can't you all stay another year?"""							0
1134	L:	We have rivalries to beat!							0
1135	S:	"They was marching down, and he said, ""There go my whole football team!"							0
1136	S:	""" I thought that was really nice."							0
1137	S:	But they respected him and he gave them respect.							0
1138	S:	We were a very close-knit family.							0
1139	S:	It was really, really good.							0
1140	L:	It's really just invaluable, you know?							0
1141	L:	To have that.							0
1142	L:	When you say like you can't get it back, it's like you can't even get that dynamic anymore.							0
1143	S:	No you can't!							0
1144	S:	You can't.							0
1145	S:	"Even if Lincoln—if they say, ""Well, we going build this school here, and we going name it Lincoln High School."							0
1146	S:	""" But you think about it, it's not going to be an all-Black school."							0
1147	S:	You're not going to have the memories to put there that you could go back and look at it at sometime and see—take, for an instance, like my kids.							0
1148	S:	That's when she graduated from Hawaii Pacific in Hawaii.							0
1149	S:	She went to school there and the two girls was in that club at Edward Waters College.							0
1150	L:	The Ambassadors Club?							0
1151	S:	Yes.							0
1152	S:	You know, just things—and they bring it all right here, so in case they want to come back and just take a look, it's not scattered everywhere.							0
1153	S:	"I said, ""You can take your stuff and carry it with you."""							0
1154	S:	"""Oh, Granny!"							0
1155	S:	"We going just leave it right here, because we know you not going throw anything away, and it'll be here.							"							-1
1156	S:	"When we come, it'll be here.							"							-1
1157	S:	"We'll just look at it here."""							0
1158	L:	It's nice to have that one place.							0
1159	S:	Yes.							0
1160	S:	"They have that one place that they can come back, take a look: ""Where's so and so and so?"							0
1161	S:	""" I don't—I told Stephanie, I say, ""Stephanie, I don't have—."""							0
1162	S:	"She says, ""Oh Granny, I forgot to get you one."							0
1163	S:	Because I got to put my big one in my office.							0
1164	S:	""" I says, ""Okay, okay."							0
1165	S:	All right, all right.							0
1166	S:	Okay.							0
1167	S:	"You put it in your office and that's fine with me."""							0
1168	S:	Yeah.							0
1169	S:	But it's been so nice talking to you.							0

1384	S:	"She says, ""Oh yes, she gets dirty"							0
1385	S:	"but I don't let her get filthy."""							0
1386	L:	So you would come up even when you were living in Ft.							0
1387	L:	Lauderdale, you'd come up to Rochelle's vacation Bible school?							0
1388	S:	No, we'd come for vacation.							0

1441	L:	Thank you so much for doing this.							0
1442	S:	You're welcome.							0
1443	L:	I had—it was wonderful.							0

1445	S:	"I was glad to be able to do it, because I really did love my school!							"							-1
1446	S:	I really did.							0
1447	S:	I really did.							0
1448	S:	Because we really had to learn a lot.							0
1449	S:	I learned to sew, I learned to cook, I learned the etiquette of it, you know— how to do everything; we was taught that.							0
1450	S:	I was, I'm thinking myself, we were being trained as if we was not going to go any further than high school.							0
1451	S:	That's the way I—I mean, to me.							0
1452	S:	That's the way I felt.							0
1453	S:	"At least you would be.							"							-1
1454	L:	If you needed to go out—							0
1455	S:	If you needed to go out and you had children, you could make their clothes, you could cook—you know, I mean—							0
1456	L:	They raised the whole—everything.							0
1457	L:	Every aspect, they covered.							0
1458	S:	So, we was taught that.							0
1459	L:	Actually, if I have some extra questions, like if I, when I type it out and stuff, may I contact you again?							0
1460	S:	Yes.							0
1461	L:	And honestly, I'm actually really interested to hear maybe, possibly coming back and talking about you being a nurse and working in the hospitals in Gainesville.							0
1462	L:	If you're ever interested, I'd love to hear it!							0
1463	S:	Well I enjoyed my work, because the people always would say—you know I had problems just like everybody else, but when I'd get to my job site, just before I walk in that door, everything was left outside.							0
1464	S:	I'd go in and I'd have a smile, and everybody say that's the way I was in school.							0
1465	S:	"And somebody told me, say, ""Margaret, you still have that smile."							0
1466	S:	When are you going to lose it?							0
1467	S:	""" I hope I never do."							0
1468	S:	But that's the way I was.							0
1469	S:	I mean I didn't let—because there was nothing I could do about it.							0
1470	S:	So I know the patients, they're feeling bad.							0
1471	S:	"They don't need you to be sour and not do something, just talk to them rough or anything.							"							-1
1472	S:	I didn't do that.							0
1473	S:	I remember I had this patient, she was a kidney patient of Dr. Cade.							0
1474	S:	Do you remember Dr. Cade?							0
1475	L:	Yes,							0
1476	L:	yeah.							0
1477	S:	He started that Gatorade and he used to bring it in a quart jar.							0
1478	S:	And he used to take a little medicine cup, and maybe he'd give this one fifteen cc's, and that one might need thirty.							0
1479	S:	But it was not too much, because they couldn't have a lot of fluids.							0
1480	S:	So, he was doing that.							0
1481	S:	And they brought this lady in from Jacksonville, and she was my patient and I remember they put her on 464.							0
1482	S:	"I says, ""Actually, she looks pretty sick."							0
1483	S:	"She really needs to be in ICU"""							0
1484	S:	"She was in and out of it, so I kept—they always said be careful of what you're saying, because even—the brain is the last to go.							"							-1
1485	S:	So—and they hear you—you know, talking.							0
1486	S:	And sometimes they can come back and tell.							0
1487	L:	Even if they're unconscious and not responsive, they can tell.							0
1488	S:	Yes, mmhm!							0
1489	S:	They can tell you.							0
1490	S:	So, I finally got her put in medical intensive care, and she went home to Jacksonville.							0
1491	S:	Then she got better, and she went home							0
1492	S:	and she came back.							0
1493	S:	"And I guess she remembered my face or something, but she says, ""You took very good care of me."""							0
1494	S:	"I said, ""You sure it was me?"""							0
1495	S:	"She say, ""Yes, it was you."							0
1496	S:	"You was the one that kept saying I needed to be in intensive care, and somehow I got to intensive care							"							-1
1497	S:	"and I know you had a hand in it."""							0
1498	S:	"And then I looked at her name—she wasn't my patient—and then I looked and said, ""Oh yes, I remember you now."""							0
1499	S:	"She say, ""Yes, and I thank you so much."							0
1500	S:	If I had stayed where I was, I probably wouldn't have made it.							0
1501	S:	""" I says, ""Well, I don't know about that, but I'm glad you're doing much better."""							0
1502	S:	So I think she lived like maybe two more years.							0
1503	S:	"Then I asked Dr. Cade about her and he told me, ""You really did have a profound something on her, because she asked about you."""							0
1504	S:	So, she remembered my name and everything!							0
1505	S:	"So I says, ""Okay, well I'm glad I did something to really help."							0
1506	S:	""" I had this patient that when I did private duty, he had had this major heart attack, stroke, and everything, and brought him from the VA"							0
1507	S:	The lady thought he was just going to live about two weeks.							0
1508	S:	That's what they told him.							0
1509	S:	And I start working with him; I worked for him for seven years.							0
1510	L:	Wow.							0
1511	L:	"From that point when they were like, ""He's got this long."							0
1512	L:	""""							0
1513	L:	Seven years!							0
1514	S:	And she'd just leave me in!							0
1515	S:	"The last time I had to get him to the hospital, he said, ""Don't call the rescue, you can get me there!"							0
1516	S:	"You can get me there!"""							0
1517	S:	"I said, ""I don't know if I can do that."							0
1518	S:	"I better call the re—"" ""No!"							0
1519	S:	No!							0
1520	S:	No!							0
1521	S:	You'll get me there!							0
1522	S:	You'll get me there!							0
1523	S:	""" I had all of his cars to get him in, and I'm trying to call her to tell her she needs to get to the hospital."							0
1524	S:	"""You handle it!"							0
1525	S:	"I'll be there!							"							-1
1526	S:	"You handle it!"""							0
1527	S:	"I say, ""Oh, don't put it all on me; you need to be here to see about your husband!"							0
1528	S:	"He's in here."""							0
1529	S:	And he and I both was in the hospital at the same time.							0
1530	S:	And I saw her							0
1531	S:	and I looked, so I asked the nurse.							0
1532	S:	"I say, ""Is there a Mr. Herndon in ICU?"""							0
1533	S:	"She say, ""I'll check to see."""							0
1534	S:	"I said, ""Well, when you go back, see if his wife is in there."							0
1535	S:	"She's a little short lady and her name is Herndon."""							0
1536	S:	So she got her							0
1537	S:	and she brought her in there.							0
1538	S:	"She say, ""Margaret, you wouldn't want to see him."							0
1539	S:	"He wouldn't want you to see him that way."""							0
1540	S:	He was on his way out and he got really, really sick.							0
1541	S:	"She say, ""I don't want you to see him like that."							0
1542	S:	"I can't hardly take it myself."""							0
1543	S:	"I says, ""Okay, all right."							0
1544	S:	I'll keep you in my prayers.							0
1545	S:	Saying everything so nice.							0
1546	S:	""" I went to see her cause they had put her in Oak Hammock."							0
1547	S:	"She say, ""You know I don't want to be here, can't you take care of me?"""							0
1548	S:	"I says, ""I wish I could!"							0
1549	S:	I just came by to see you!							0
1550	S:	I wish I could take care of you, but I can't.							0
1551	S:	"I just can't."""							0
1552	S:	Because since all of that, I have a pacemaker, and I have a stint put in.							0
1553	S:	I just can't take care of her.							0
1554	L:	You've got to take care of you!							0
1555	S:	"Yeah, I can't have a lot of pressure on me anymore, and Dr. Silverstein told me, he says, ""I don't want you to stress."							0
1556	S:	"I don't want you to stress yourself."""							0
1557	S:	So I know that I wouldn't want to take that on.							0
1558	S:	I wish I would've been in shape to take care of her, because she was nice to me.							0
1559	S:	They both were.							0
1560	S:	They didn't have any children.							0
1561	S:	And her nephew, they sort of like adopted him, and he lives in some part of South Carolina.							0
1562	S:	And he wouldn't get married.							0
1563	S:	"He says, ""I'm not going to get married if y'all can't come."""							0
1564	S:	"So she said, ""But Turner!"""							0
1565	S:	"I says, ""Oh, he can ride that plane with you!"							0
1566	S:	"Because when I used to take him everywhere he needed to go."""							0
1567	S:	But she, you know he was letting her know that.							0
1568	S:	"I say, ""You can do it."							0
