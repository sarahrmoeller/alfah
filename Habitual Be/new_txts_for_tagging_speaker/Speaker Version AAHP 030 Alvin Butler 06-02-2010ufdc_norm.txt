B:	"""in Kirkwood,"""
B:	and it didn’t go higher.
B:	"""When I was seventh grade,"""
B:	we had to go to Micanopy to school.
B:	And my daddy bought me a bicycle I rode to Micanopy every morning.
B:	"""And it was the superintendent here finally,"""
B:	"""and the following year,"""
B:	I went towards the ninth grade.
B:	So I went on back up there in Kirkwood ‘til I completed ninth grade.

B:	"""the school bus picked up the White children right in front of our house,"""
B:	our house right beside the highway.
B:	"""Right next to the highway,"""
B:	it’s there now.

B:	Between seven and eight White children rode the bus every morning.
B:	We got to school best we could.
B:	"""And I say,"""
B:	about 85 or 90 percent of the kids that completed ninth grade didn’t go to high school because they couldn’t get to school.
B:	"""But I was fortunate enough they bought me a- I had bought a car when I was fourteen years old,"""
B:	"""and I drove to town,"""
B:	and five more children rode with me.
B:	"""When I went to high school,"""
B:	it wasn’t but four students had automobiles.
B:	"""Now,"""

B:	And I think five of the teachers had cars.
B:	"""And the man running the funeral home,"""
B:	he and one of the students had a car.
B:	"""And the guy that live in the house down there,"""
B:	his father had a car— his father was just passed.
B:	"""And he’s buried in West Palm Beach,"""
B:	I think. []
B:	What kind of car did you get when you were fourteen?

B:	"""Yeah,"""
B:	we rode to school together.
B:	Gas was thirteen to nineteen cent a gallon.

B:	"""And it wouldn’t work now,"""
B:	"""because you had to have a sticker on your car,"""
B:	an A coupon or B A sticker got only three gallon a week;
B:	"""and if you had a B,"""
B:	you get four gallons per car a week.
B:	"""And a C,"""
B:	"""like you doing commercial work—well see,"""
B:	my father farmed.
B:	He had books like this of C-stamps.
B:	"""Each stamp was five,"""
B:	you could purchase five gallons of gas with it.
B:	"""And a tractor would start on kerosene,"""
B:	and kerosene wasn’t rationed.
B:	"""You would crank it up on a little bit of gas,"""
B:	and switch it on gasoline.
B:	And one of the servicemen if you gave it to him he'll do it which is when I'd buy gas with it. And I had gas to ride all around. But I was going to Lakeland high school then. And I would have to-we-we had a reunion a few months. So my school- I hadn't been to that school since 1950. I hadn't been in there. That's in my when I was in high school. The older two of us were different changing []. So I came out of the Class of 44.
B:	"""Speaking of Lincoln High School,"""

B:	"""They had the same bathroom say “White” and other say “Colored."""""""
B:	""" And the water fountain in quite a few of those stores didn’t have no electricity to it,"""
B:	just regular water fountain.
B:	The other fountain had a cooler system on it.
B:	"""I’d say,"""
B:	we traveled on the highway.

B:	"""and you’d stop to the service station,"""
B:	and some didn’t have no bathrooms for Black.
B:	No.
B:	They had that “White only”
B:	"""So you had to plan your trip accordingly,"""

B:	we didn’t buy gasoline.
B:	"""Some had bathrooms that said “Colored Only,"""
B:	 had it all filled up with old car tires and things.
