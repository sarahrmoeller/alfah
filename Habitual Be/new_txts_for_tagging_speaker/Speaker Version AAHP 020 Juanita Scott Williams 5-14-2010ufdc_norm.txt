MW:	You want to hear about them?
R:	"Please,"""
R:	mmhm.
JW:	"Well,"""
JW:	"""to begin with,"""
JW:	she was the only Black in the top ten graduating class.
JW:	"""They fooled around and put nine children in the newspaper,"""
JW:	and called them the top ten.
R:	They didn’t put her picture in the newspaper?
MW:	They didn’t put it in there to start with. They didn't put it in there to start with. 
MW:	"Now what year was this,"""
MW:	her senior year?
R:	76.
R:	"76,"""
R:	okay.
R:	They didn’t put it in there.

R:	"""if you think you got a problem,"""
R:	bring it home you know.
R:	She brought the problem home.
R:	"""Went out there the next day,"""

R:	You called it “top ten.
R:	""" Now,"""
R:	what do we do?
MW:	"You got nine,"""
MW:	there.
JW:	I say you owe an apology to my daughter.
JW:	Okay?
JW:	You owe her an apology.
R:	"Now,"""
R:	"""was she number ten,"""
R:	or she was in the top ten but she was higher than number ten?
MW:	She was in the top ten.
R:	"Okay,"""
R:	so she wasn’t necessarily number ten? She was just in the top ten? 
R:	"No,"""
R:	I don’t know—
R:	"""—which number she was,"""
R:	but she was in the top ten.
R:	"""I don’t know which number,"""
R:	I don’t know whether she was number four or number—
R:	"Well if you going to be top ten,"""
R:	"""then your top ten go in the paper,"""
R:	instead of nine.
JW:	"Well she couldn’t have been number ten,"""
JW:	or they probably would’ve recognized the top nine.
JW:	"""So,"""
JW:	"""she was in the top ten,"""
JW:	and she was left out.
JW:	They had to take another picture and put it in the paper— 
JW:	Well that’s good.
MW:	—and undo that mistake.
MW:	""" and I told them it could be a racial—“No,"""
MW:	"""no,"""
MW:	"""no,"""

R:	It was—yeah.
R:	"""And she and then,"""
R:	they block-voted and did the Daughters of American Revolution.
MW:	Mhm 
R:	They did not take her up there to the meeting.
R:	I took her to the Daughters of American Revolution meeting.
R:	Tallahassee.
MW:	Was that something that was automatically conveyed upon students with a certain grade?
R:	"No,"""
R:	no.
R:	It was something that the students voted for.
MW:	Okay.
R:	"This decided that they were going to do one of us,"""
R:	and they chose her.
R:	"""And Then when they block-voted,"""
R:	Uh she won.
R:	It took them about a week to answer and put it on the loudspeaker who won.
R:	They didn’t want her to be the winner!
MW:	Oh Okay.
MW:	Who was the principal of the school at this time?
JW:	I don’t even know!
JW:	I don’t even know.
JW:	She knows.
MW:	Doctor Hart came with them.
MW:	But-but-but I got to the lady’s house.
MW:	I had her address and name in my purse.
MW:	She told me there was not going to be a meeting at her house.
MW:	"""I said,"""
MW:	"""“Oh yes,"""
MW:	there is a meeting.
MW:	"""This is the number that the school gave me,"""

JW:	"""if you feel anything going on wrong in there,"""
JW:	"""you’re twelfth grade,"""
JW:	you ought to know when you’re being ill-treated.
JW:	Don’t stay in there.
JW:	"""So We got back,"""
JW:	"""everything’s wonderful,"""
JW:	"""she said they were nice,"""
JW:	but why?
MW:	She sat there under the tree.
MW:	Yeah I sat there under the tree.
MW:	I wasn’t going to leave my child!
MW:	Under the tree.
MW:	I didn’t say you did wrong.
MW:	"I was waiting under the tree,"""

MW:	"""and say that somebody bothering me,"""
MW:	because the lady told me there wasn’t going to be a meeting.
MW:	I remember all those funny things.
MW:	What about that girl that didn’t get their words straight?
R:	Huh?
MW:	"About her words,"""
MW:	she didn’t get it straight.
R:	Which one?
R:	Hmm?

R:	"""You don’t forget that,"""
R:	that was funny.
R:	"Okay Now see,"""
R:	you did not tell me you were Reverend Reaves.
R:	I didn’t know that you were a minister.
MW:	Mmhm.
MW:	"Yeah,"""
MW:	I could write you a book about the experiences.
MW:	"I didn’t realize that all of them down in Mississippi taught me out of Jacksonville,"""
MW:	during the WPA program.
MW:	"""And I didn’t think about that,"""
MW:	and he gave me a certificate anyway.
MW:	"""I said,"""
MW:	well that might be why I made a with that art.
R:	What?
MW:	Artwork.
R:	Oh.
MW:	You know they stopped having the art program here in the mill?
MW:	My children went on it for a couple of years.
MW:	"""And they didn't-for some reason,"""
MW:	they just went out.
MW:	"""Didn’t bother me,"""
MW:	but they always honor the children.
MW:	They did ribbons.
MW:	But for some reason they just didn’t do them anymore.
R:	What did your daughter—?

R:	"""I had a box for these one,"""
R:	"""they disappeared,"""
R:	I don’t know where they went.

R:	Make some more.
MW:	"Well,"""
MW:	I could send them back to the house or to the big bookstore over there and get some more.
MW:	Okay.
JW:	It’s the only one I have.
MW:	What did you—?
MW:	I was about to ask you about your daughter’s education.
MW:	Where did she go to um receive her Bachelor’s degree?
R:	She received her Bachelor’s degree in Pharmacy at Florida A&M Then she received a Doctorate in Pharmacology at Florida A&M
R:	Where did she get the Master’s from?
R:	"Then You don’t get Master’s in that program,"""
R:	you get the Doctorate.
R:	"""And then,"""
R:	"""she went to Howard University,"""
R:	professor for however many years.
R:	"""Then she decided that she didn’t want to do that,"""
R:	because she was teaching men your probably your age that was older than she was.
R:	"""At this point,"""
R:	"""she was liketwenty-four,"""
R:	"""and um at this time also,"""
R:	"""a professor had gotten shot at university at FSU because he failed to change a grade on a boy that was trying to get out so he could go to work,"""
R:	"""and he ask him over and over,"""
R:	you say you’re not going to change the grade?
R:	"""And what he did was out from under his shirt,"""
R:	like you wearing now—
R:	Did the man die?
R:	He kill him right there!
R:	He told him he wasn’t going to change the grade.
MW:	I never heard this story.

MW:	That was in the paper.
R:	"I told her to give me some more work,"""
R:	didn’t I?
JW:	Mmhm.

JW:	that might have happened?
R:	I don’t remember.
R:	"""I don’t even know whether he was Black or White,"""
R:	I don’t remember that.
MW:	Probably early 80s since your daughter graduated high school in '76.
R:	Mmhm.
R:	"""But anyway,"""
R:	"""Uh uh they told her,"""
R:	you up here trying to flunk somebody and you still got milk around your mouth!
MW:	and She didn’t want to stay?
MW:	I thought it was too cold for her.
R:	She didn’t want to stay in that profession.
R:	"""Yeah Those fellows,"""
R:	"""she said they were harder,"""
R:	"""they were—and she was trying to be sure that they were ready to take the National Pharmacy Exam,"""
R:	"""and the Washington exams,"""
R:	"""and things,"""
R:	"""and she had to grade like you supposed to,"""
R:	and they wanted her to—
MW:	Pass them through.
R:	"Kind of,"""
R:	you know...
R:	Yeah.
R:	Pad them the court.
MW:	You go out there and play with people health because you don’t know what you’re doing.
R:	She had a responsibility to make sure they knew what they were doing.
MW:	Yeah.
MW:	"Because she’s certifying that they’re certifiable,"""
MW:	"""so it’s her reputation,"""
MW:	really.
R:	"Yes,"""
R:	it was on the line.
R:	"""So she thought,"""
R:	"""“Well let me come out of here,"""
R:	""" and then she moved back to Miami,"""
R:	and went to University of Miami.
R:	For law school?
MW:	Law school.
R:	Okay.
MW:	Jurisprudence.
R:	Mmhm.
R:	Yeah.
R:	That’s a marvelous career.
R:	So she’s been practicing law.
MW:	Yeah.
JW:	For twenty years.
JW:	Not quite twenty.
JW:	Not quite twenty?
MW:	She graduated from college in 81. She graduated again in 83 and she graduated again in about 86.
JW:	Okay.
JW:	Well that’s 24 years since 86.
MW:	Yeah.
MW:	She’s been practicing a bit.
MW:	"""But at one point she was working seven days,"""
MW:	and all seven in pharmacy.
MW:	"""Then,"""
MW:	"""she used that time—her dad was sick—to fly over me and go to Quincy to see her daddy,"""
MW:	and fly back to Miami.
MW:	She didn’t stop by Perry.
MW:	She loved her daddy so much.
JW:	She flew and—
MW:	She flew into Tallahassee and drove out to Quincy.
JW:	"She drove out to Quincy,"""
JW:	"""rented a car,"""
JW:	drove to Quincy.
JW:	"""Then,"""
JW:	"""that was in these seven days off,"""
JW:	"""and at that time,"""
JW:	she’d do about three days with him and go back and work on law.
JW:	"""Now she’s full-time law,"""
JW:	"""and doing-keeping her pharmacy certificate alive,"""
JW:	and doing pharmacy when she get ready.
MW:	Mhm
JW:	"Yep,"""
JW:	"""so,"""
JW:	that is what she doing now.
JW:	"Well,"""
JW:	"""I’ve enjoyed talking to you all,"""
JW:	"""and I hate to take it so long that you get bored with it or you know everybody gets tired,"""
JW:	"""so maybe this’ll be a good time for a break and you talk about me coming back again sometime,"""
JW:	if um that is convenient for you all.
JW:	I’ve very much enjoyed our conversation.
JW:	But I always like to close an interview with asking the people I’m speaking with to offer some kind of reflection.
JW:	"""You know maybe something you liked about the interview,"""
JW:	"""or something you thought we didn’t talk about,"""
JW:	or just whatever your comments might be.
JW:	"""And then,"""
JW:	"""after you make those comments,"""
JW:	that’ll be the end of the interview.
MW:	"you know I was wondering as we talked if we were reaching what you needed,"""
MW:	"""and if we were supplying the kind of information you need,"""
MW:	or really what were you going to do with it?
MW:	Did you want me to answer?
R:	Yes.
R:	"Okay,"""
R:	because normally I would just end at this point.
R:	"What were you going to do with it,"""
R:	is the question.
R:	"No,"""
R:	"""I think that these answers have been very good,"""
R:	they’ve provided some very unique insight.
R:	"""I’ve never interviewed two sisters at once to talk about issues in African-American history in Florida,"""
R:	so this is a first for me to do it this way.
R:	The purpose of the African-American History Project is to gather three hundred stories from African-Americans um on what it’s like to be Black in the south and in Florida.
R:	"""This particular part in Taylor County has some very unique resonance for me because I don’t know many other people who have studied Taylor County,"""
R:	"""so my goals are just to gather information,"""
R:	"""to find out as much as possible,"""
R:	"""Um perhaps publish a paper one day about what we’ve talked about,"""
R:	or perhaps one day to write a book about what we’ve talked about.
R:	But primarily to collect information for the oral history archives at the University of Florida.
R:	So That’s the primary mission that I’m working on right now.
MW:	You know it’d have been nice had I let you see what all written up about from the University of Florida.
MW:	Oh really?
MW:	"Yeah,"""
MW:	"""well anyway,"""
MW:	I’ll tell you what it’s like.
MW:	"""They’re concerned about building up the waterways,"""
MW:	"""putting down ramps,"""
MW:	"""and different things,"""
MW:	"""and highways in Taylor County,"""
MW:	and they wanted to know how I felt about it.
MW:	"""Well,"""
MW:	have I ever been out there doing anything?
MW:	"""Well the only thing I’ve ever been out there when my husband was living,"""
MW:	"""I went out there and fished sometimes,"""
MW:	"""and we’d walk bare- feeted in the water and pick up some of them little old shrimps or crabs or something that they liked to eat,"""
MW:	and go wading.
MW:	"""That’s about all I’ve ever done,"""
MW:	is fish.
MW:	"Yeah,"""
MW:	"""because,"""
MW:	"""see,"""
MW:	it would take me five minutes to go and get—then I would know whether you can really use it or not or whether—what you would want to do with it.
MW:	Let me go and get this.
JW:	"Well Thank you very much for being willing to do that,"""
JW:	"""and I'm um like I said this is part of a three year project we’re doing,"""
JW:	"""so I hope that more than even me writing a paper,"""
JW:	"""or writing a book,"""
JW:	"""or getting something into the archives,"""
JW:	"""that because we’ve had these conversations,"""
JW:	"""that it’s interested you enough that you will let some more of my colleagues come and speak with you and find out more about what life was like,"""
JW:	and maybe even introduce us to some other people in the community who you feel may be able to help us answer further questions about what’s going on.
JW:	"""So,"""
JW:	I look at this more of introduction.
MW:	Let me see if if you can perhaps use something that I got.
MW:	Okay.
JW:	"Yeah,"""
JW:	"""because if you bring something by the school,"""
JW:	I wish I could—
M:	"I would like to take some pictures of this stuff,"""
M:	I just didn’t want to stop with the interview that we were doing.
JW:	What you say now?
JW:	"""I want to take some pictures of the yearbook,"""
JW:	"""and some of your certificates,"""
JW:	I was just—we were in the interview.
JW:	It’s all right to take some of them certificates just in those books.
MW:	"Okay,"""
MW:	"""and just to close out the interview,"""
MW:	this is Marna Weston with the Oral History Program.
MW:	"""Today I’ve spoken with Juanita Scott Williams,"""
MW:	"""and with Laura Scott Reaves in Missus Reaves’ home in Perry Florida,"""
MW:	"""and this is Mar- pardon me May 14,"""
MW:	2010
