and just let you know that this interview is to be added to the oral history archives at the University of Florida.
"We wanted to make sure that people everywhere can know about Taylor County and its history,"
"because believe it or not,"
"Taylor County is one of the places where people acknowledge that a lot of things happened,"
but nobody has written about them and published them.
"It’s not something that is um you know widely—people talk about Rosewood in 1920,"
"and people talk about Ocoee,"
"which happened afterwards,"
but—
S: Rosewood here.
Do you have any written literature or anything anywhere?

It was us that moved in from that storm-stricken area.
When did you tell me it was in—?
"W: 1928,"
"if it was the 1920s,"
if you were in the second grade.
"S: Storm tore up that house,"
and they had brought us over there in that little three- room house.
Before he built.
And they was so glad.
And we went running in that house.
"W: Well there was another big storm in 35,"
but maybe that didn’t come through here.
Or did it?
R: Yes it did.
S: Yes it did.
W: You were three years old.
S: Mmhm.
W: Do you remember that storm?
S: Not that much.
I remember seeing everything just… cleared away.
"You know,"
"it just look clean out there,"
like like someone had just cleaned everything.
But not that much.
"W: What is your earliest memories of your of your parents,"
"and living at home,"
what was it like when you were very young with them?
S: What was it really like over there?
"W: Yeah,"
do you have any memories come to mind?
"You know Maybe you had a pet,"
"or maybe you had some chores,"
"or maybe a special day happened with you and your family your brothers and sisters,"
what was it like from your your very young eyes to look at the world with your parents?
"S: A definite thing was to go to school and…just just go to school and… just go to school,"
"basically,"
and go to whatever there was going on at the church or wherever you had to go.
"And you had to obey,"
I tell you that.
What else?
"And You were vocalized in you going and we were not allowed to,"
"like,"
"roam around,"
we had to do—in the backyard and share and play with each other.
"Now it was thirteen,"
so you didn’t get lonesome for anybody to play with.
W: Did you have chores that you had to do?
S: Oh my!
"R: Like,"
"we had to go off to work,"
"and she was pitiful,"
we left her with all these brothers!
She had a lot of work to do.
"What did you like to cook,"
peas and greens and things?
"No,"
"if we pick ‘em and peel ‘em for her she would cook and eat ‘em,"
but mama had her doing so much work.
"I was gone,"
and the other three girls she had.
W: So you—?
"S: Homework was very definite,"
and my mother was ill.
She had ulcerated stomach.
And I remember one thing in particular.
"I had—my girlfriends were out there,"
"and they were playing ball,"
and I had to do the greens.
"And my mother was ill,"
"and she was in the room,"
"right there,"
next to the pump.
"I had to pump water to wash these greens,"
while the kids were out there playing ball.
"So I said,"
"going in the house with those greens,"
"the one that eat the most greens,"
eat the most grit!
"R: Juanita,"
you didn’t wash it?
"S: I washed them two times,"
"but Gloria and Vearl and Alfonso and everybody was like,"
"“They’re playing ball,"
" and I wanted to play,"
too!
"R: Boy,"
if Mama had found that out.
S: She found it out!
R: What did she say!
S: And from that day to this one— 
R: You wash the greens good?
"S: I have not washed,"
"I have not cooked,"
any gritty greens.
"Those greens were so gritty,"
you could push the greens to the side in the pot and there’ll be dirt overthere.
And that dirt caused those greens to be gritty.
"And actually,"
"when you would chew down on the green,"
you would chew grit!
And I got a spanking.
"W: See,"
that’s something that a kid today wouldn’t even know what that is.
"When you say you got a spanking,"
what do you mean?
S: What do I mean?
W: Mmhm.
"S: I mean,"
my mother whipped me!
"She got from sick,"
"disgusted about her dinner,"
and actually whipped me.
W: So she found some energy.
S: She found some energy!
"W: Now was it with a switch,"
"or was it with a belt,"
or do you remember?
"S: Yeah,"
it was with a switch from outside.
W: Did you have to go get the switch?
"S: And guess what,"
I had to go and get it.
W: You had to go get it.
"My grandma used to make me go get the switch,"
too.
"S: Oh,"
she did?
W: Yes ma’am.
"That was part of me,"
you had to go get it.
And you better not bring back no little one either.
S: You had to go get it.
"And believe it or not,"
you better not run.
"W: No,"
"no,"
"no,"
you couldn’t run!
"S: Oh,"
boy.
W: So what other chores did you have besides the greens?
"S: Oh um,"
there were many-many things to do.
"You had to you had to make up the beds,"
"and sweep the floor,"
"and all these kinds of things,"
because there was thirteen of us.
"And there were one person,"
"my dad,"
"was working,"
"making saw mill salary,"
and of course my mom was taking in washing and ironing.
"W: When you say she was taking in washing and ironing,"
what do you mean?
"S: I mean she was—um White people would bring their clothes to the house,"
"and she would wash them on the rubber wood outside,"
and hang them outside.
Then she would bring them in and iron them.
"Ans then Incidentally,"
"she was ironing with the smoothing iron,"
and the ironing board was the fireplace.
"W: So you're saying When you say a smoothing iron,"
"you say it wasn’t electric,"
you didn’t plug it in.
S: It wasn’t electric.
"W: Okay,"
so she had to heat up the iron separately.
"S: She had to heat up the iron separately,"
and the handle would be hot.
"Then she had to use a separate bath cloth,"
"or whatever it was,"
"to hold this iron,"
and to iron those people White shirts.
"W: Now why did She did that for extra money,"
or…?
S: She did that for extra money.
W: Mmhm.
How many families did she take in washing and ironing for?
S: Several.
W: Mmhm.
And they were happy to have her do it?
S: They were happy to have her do it.
They would bring them back over and over.
"and sometimes,"
"if uh if she needed to,"
"she would send my brothers with the red wagon,"
"about so big,"
to go and get them.
"W: Okay,"
"so “so big,"
 I’m saying that’s about… a foot and a half?
"S: No,"
"it was bigger than a foot and a half,"
"could be two,"
"two,"
three inches.
"When I say that I’m talking about a wagon ‘bout…three,"
three foot.
W: Three foot wide.
Now how high off the floor are you showing me?
S: Just about that high.
"W: Okay,"
so about—
"S: A wagon,"
you’ve seen a wagon.
Like a little red wagon?
Little red wagon.
W: Okay.
"S: Only thing,"
it was a big one!
W: Uh-huh.
"So,"
"okay,"
"there were chores,"
"and your dad worked at the mill,"
and your mom took in laundry.
What other kind of things happened around your house when you were growing up?
What what about Did relatives come over?
"Did did um Did you have big dinners,"
"was there singing,"
was there entertainment?
What kind of things did you do at your house?
S: We always had a piano.
"And My brother Edward played for the church,"
"and my brother Howard—they’re dead now—played around at school,"
and all those kind of things.
"And incidentally,"
I played for my church forever.
"W: Mhm So you learned how to play the piano,"
and— 
"S: I did,"
a little bit.
"W: And all-Most of your other brothers and sisters learned how to play,"
too?
Or they all played some kind of instrument?
S: No.
"Well,"
my brother Howard played saxophone.
W: Okay.
S: Mmhm.
And That’s the only one that I believe played sax.
"Yeah,"
that’s the only one.
W: Do you ever remember any trouble when you were growing up?
"You know Problems with some of the neighbors,"
"or some of the kids,"
or things that were taking place that you all were you know unsure or scared about?
"S: Um I think I told you initially that we didn’t get a lot of places without supervision,"
so there were less problems.
"My mother didn’t allow us to be over there and over there,"
unsupervised and roaming.
You had to be where she knew where you were. You couldn't be
"If she let me go over to my friend’s house,"
"I better be back home by the time that sun turns red looking over there,"
or I’m called a midnight rambler.
"So so we didn’t have a whole lot of…let’s call it,"
behavior problems.
"Nevertheless We were not angels,"
so to speak.
"We had minor stuff,"
but nothing nothin' big.
"We weren't-We weren’t jail freaks,"
because were in sorta in the backyard playing.
"W: I think what I kind of meant was problems from the community,"
toward you and your family or toward other Black people.
Were there you know problems that you remember from your childhood?
"You know things that happened that people knew,"
oh this was a bad thing and…
S: Like?
"W: Well,"
"for example people would ask,"
"considering Taylor County,"
"things about Klan activity,"
"or maybe there would have been people that wanted some property or something that somebody else had,"
and because they were a Black person they were kind of maybe—strongly persuaded to give up those interests for somebody else.
Do you recall any of those things kind of happening as you grew up in Taylor County?
"S: Now,"
"she would probably be best to answer that,"
because I don’t remember.
"I can remember when a Black person moves into a community,"
that community you see signs going up on the other opposite race property for sale.
"“For Sale,"
 “For Sale.
" And when you know anything,"
"the White folk just—I didn’t mean to even say their name—the opposite race,"
they just gone.
They not there anymore.
"W: And you’ve seen that happen,"
many times.
S: I’ve seen that happen!
"It is happening,"
"now,"
"in the quarters,"
"where we call the “latest quarters,"
" where there is Alice Street,"
"and Sarah Street,"
and all of those kind.
"A few Black people moved in there,"
and they still have empty houses over there.
"And those opposite race people that just can’t afford to move are still in there,"
but they are basically gone.
I’m talking about in reference to the French Quarters over there.
R: I know.
I know what they doing over there.
"S: Now,"
"she could probably tell you something about schools burning and all this kind of thing that we don’t,"
I wouldn’t really know about.
"W: Okay,"
we talked about school.
What are your earliest memories of going to school?
What’s the first school that you went to?
"S: Uh the first school that I went to was,"
Jerkins High School.
"W: Okay,"
and—
R: Jerkins was there when you went first time?
You didn’t go to the White building?
What is the name of the White man that gave us all this money?
R: Carnegie?
"W: Rosenwald,"
there was a Rosenwald schools.
R: Rosenwald.
But there’s another one.
"Rosenwald,"
I remember that.
"But here’s what happened,"
is I never went to school that the county bought.
"No,"
I never did.
"I always went in a church,"
in a little green schoolhouse with four rooms.
They burned they burned it down.
"Well,"
we went a long time and didn’t have a school.
W: Who burned the school down?
R: The same people that didn’t want us want us educated.
W: Okay.
R: Okay?
All right?
"Then,"
"after that school was burned down,"
"we took a long time,"
we went to school in Missus Seneca home.
"We went to school in the Springhill Church,"
"Uh Sweet Home Church,"
"and Brooklyn Churches,"
but we just didn’t keep one.
"We couldn’t keep one,"
they always got burned up.
"Well,"
"when Professor Jerkins came,"
"he uh knew about this plan and who was giving Black people things,"
but I don’t think this came from Rosenwald.
But I remember Rosenwald was a Black man’s friend.
"Okay,"
"well,"
he wrote in for them to give the children in Perry a school.
And they wrote back and told him they couldn’t give the children in Perry a school because he didn’t have a name for it.
"The name was Perry Credit Schools,"
and he wouldn’t give us a name for that school.
"Well,"
"he wrote back,"
and they did give him an opportunity to get him a name.
"So,"
"he named two of the old teachers’ names: Lily Jones,"
"Sara Roundtree,"
and Jessie Bowman.
And there was somebody else that was here—uh uh Johnny Belle Moore.
"Well,"
"when they got together,"
"they all talked about this different characters and things like that,"
"where they concluded that Jerkins was the one causing it to come,"
and it should be named Jerkins.
"W: And that’s the school that you went,"
the Jerkins school?
"R: That’s the one,"
S: yes.
R: Yes.
W: Now there’s a little bit of a difference in you all’s age.
"You were older when your sister was born,"
1919 and 1932.
"R: I told you I’d stand on the block washing dishes,"
"and cooking grits,"
and frying bacon!
W: Uh-huh.
"So,"
"what has your relationship been like as sisters,"
with her being your older sister and—and you know you grew up a little bit differently because she was twelve or thirteen when you were born.
"So what has that been like for you,"
that relationship?
"S: Oh,"
boy!
W: You all are laughing.
S: Huh?
"W: You all are laughing,"
why are you laughing?
"R: Because when she fight me,"
Mama whoop her!
"S: Well,"
"that’s true now,"
that is true.
"And getting now it’s two more of us,"
"and uh when our mother would go to town,"
"of course she was in charge,"
okay?
W: Okay.
"S: And uh the girls now—it wasn’t me,"
I didn’t do that—felt like they was going to get a beating anyway.
"So they would—and they couldn’t call her a dog,"
they called her a peanut stew.
"And uh and uh she might decide to tell Mama when they got the stool on there that they call her that they call her a fool and then they'll get a beating so so they gonna so they figured out Well imma get a beating anyway , so I'm gonna I'm gonna do what I-say what I need to say "
R: Well Corinne you know what kinda pennies you know you might have been too young to remember all of this but it was a white kinda pen. Corrine when I played one day and she decided that to touch the bed and put a print on there she decided to put a lot of prints on there
"W: And You remember this,"
too?
"R: No,"
she didn’t remember that.
S: I don’t remember that one.
W: okay.
"R: Penny,"
poor penny.
"I said,"
Momma got me that time!
"She told me,"
“You had no business letting that baby do that.
" And Boy,"
"she,"
"I done forgot whether she put that switch on me or not,"
but she frosted me some about letting that baby do that.
"And after that,"
them babies didn’t do too much wrong around here.
"W: Well,"
you all are so close today that you came over to see what she was doing.
R: We’re grown enough to know better.
"S: I am Now,"
"if I had not known you were coming here,"
"I would’ve called her and asked her,"
“Who that down in your house?

W: Because you saw the truck in front?
S: I saw the truck in the front.
"You see,"
she is ninety years old and I live right down the street.
"And I have to know who’s here,"
if I don’t know who they are.
"you know,"
I live where I can just walk out the door and see if her car is out there.
"W: And I had a different car last time,"
because I came in my rental car.
"Oh,"
S: I did ask her!
I did ask her.
"R: Say,"
“Who is that down to your house?

"S: Yeah,"
I did ask her.
W: Mmhm!
"S: Sure did,"
"but basically our relationship,"
it gets kind of rocky sometimes when she doesn’t really see what I’m talking about.
"But uh it’s it's basically good,"
"and I follow her to the doctor,"
"and keep up with appointments,"
"and help her remember,"
and my-my calendar that I carry in my pocket is filled with everybody’s appointments.
"And the reason I didn’t come straight here,"
"when she called me,"
"I was making an appointment for another sister,"
the other one that’s eighty-six.
"She had an appointment next Thursday,"
and I had to do that before I left to come here.
"And I got another sister around there,"
"the corner over there,"
"that’s that's uh got some hip troubles,"
and she’s walking at this time with a walker.
"So you see,"
I’m filled with stuff to do.
And everybody’s appointment is in my book.
And she didn’t make an appointment with the nerve doctor until she saw what was in my book.
"So I knew what was in my book,"
"so I made the appointment,"
and now I’ve got to hurry back from Tallahassee with my 1:15 appointment to be with her with her four o’clock appointment.
Now that’s how we do.
R: We work together.
S: I am—
"R: Sometimes she sassing me,"
and I don’t think she should be sassing me.
But she’s good.
"I’m sorry I don’t have that write-up on the school,"
but I’ll send it to you.
"W: Oh,"
that’s quite all right.
"R: It’s over there in that box,"
the one that was published about how the school system got started.
"S: Well,"
I just told him I had about three books at my house.
What kind of books?
"I beat my books to death,"
though.
"R: Well,"
this the only one I have left here.
S: I’m saying to him that I have some stuff that I think you can use.
"W: Oh,"
really?
"Well thank you,"
I’d be happy to look at it.
"R: This book here was fixed in my honor,"
And in 1960 at the Jerkins High School.
"W: That’s a 1960 yearbook from Jerkins High School in Perry,"
Florida.
R: That’s right.
"Well I had all of them,"
"just like she had,"
but my daughter lived in Boston so she decided to get them up and take them with her.
"Now what I need,"
to go back to that house and look in there and find them and bring them back.
It might be best to let them have ‘em.
W: Why don’t you just get them scanned?
S: They wouldn’t be of any interest to them unless they were history grabbers.
"R: Yeah,"
well that’s my picture and everything.
W: This is you?
R: That’s me.
I was younger then.
S: That you?
I thought that was Miss— 
R: That’s my picture.
"S: Oh,"
R: okay.
Laura Scott Reaves.
W: The reason that I came to—
R: That’s the way I looked in 1960.
"S: Oh,"
okay.
"W: I met Christine Baines Holmes,"
"and she told me she was her teacher,"
so that’s how I ended up coming over here.
R: Christine?
S: Christine Holmes?
Live over by Brooklyn Church.
R: It’s not too far from—
"W: It’s right at the intersection of 98 and 27,"
and there’s a church across the street?
"S: Yes,"
that’s Brooklyn Church.
"W: I was driving to Tallahassee one day,"
"and I just looked to my right,"
and I just saw her going into her house and she reminded me of my grandmother.
"And Something made me go around the corner and come back and I talked to the ladies at the beauty parlor down the street and they told me,"
"oh yes she knows a lot about the history,"
"and she likes to talk,"
because I didn’t just want to show up at someone’s home.
"And then she let me speak to her,"
"and she told me about you,"
and that’s how I ended up—
R: Yeah you told me about the people sending you over.
"W: It’s actually very interesting,"
because I was on Calhoun Street over there.
R: This was my principal at that time.
He’s gone.
R: This is—
"This is the assistant principal,"
he’s gone.
W: Reverend Warner?
Pardon—
Ed Warner.
Principal Warner.
S: This was Calhoun.
W: Yes.
"S: and uh We own this property right here,"
"that over there,"
"that right—matter of fact,"
"that whole block right there,"
"and I own half of the other block,"
and the other block down there.
W: To the North and to the East?
S: Yeah.
"The family owns half of that,"
"so we justified that,"
and the street was named Elmo Scott Street.
"W: So this was all land that originally was owned by your grandfather,"
Reverend Braxton?
R: Blair and Hinely.
W: No?
"R: Blair and Hinely,"
only.
W: Blan—?
S: Blair and Hinely.

R: That’s the name of the subdivision.
S: Mmhm.

"my daddy’s daddy,"
"and my grandmother down at the dead end of this street,"
owned some more land.
My mama’s mother had Braxton.
Well you know you would go around remembering all those names.
"I told him,"
"when he come back,"
he telling them to me.
"W: Well you told me about your momma’s daddy,"
but I didn’t hear about your daddy’s daddy.
What was his name?
S: Harry Scott.
W: Harry Scott.
R: He lived on Main Street— 
He lived on Harry Scott.
"He lived about a block—no,"
on the next block over.
W: Mmhm.
"Well,"

We need somebody to fix it.
"But like my sister said,"
it’s too old.
W: Is it still owned by your family?
S: Mmhm.
R: In other words I went in there trying my best to find that other-them other two certificates you got there.
W: Mmhm.
R: But I didn’t find them.
I found…I think this just a grade sheet.
S: Do you want me to go?
I live just across the highway there.
Do you want me to go and get what I’m talking about?
"W: If it’s convenient for you that would be very nice—I don’t want to put you out with anything,"
"I’d be happy to come with you,"
"or you can bring it back,"
"or we can wait ‘til the end,"
or whatever is convenient for you.
S: Okay.
"Okay Now,"

You should have them mounted and preserved.

"W: You’ve done a very good job with them,"
to keep them.
S: Mine is in mine is in my fireproof box.
That’s where they are!
"W: Oh okay, That’s a good place for them."
But you know you see how this paper has turned yellow- brown over the years.
"You know,"
air will get to it and change them unless you preserve them.
"I have a lot of World War II documents from my mother’s grandfather in North Carolina,"
"and I’ve begun to preserve those documents for the family,"
"because they just kind of laying around everywhere—in boxes,"
"and out in barns,"
and stuff.
It just takes time to do all this stuff.
R: This is a list was sent from the school in St.
"Augustine to A&M,"
I think.
"W: Okay,"
this is your transcript.
R: Yeah.
"From that one school,"
"but the one with A&M on it,"
that’s the one I wanted.
But I told you that every school I went to was listed on there.
W: Well you took a lot of classes!
You were a good student.
I don’t see any bad grades on here.

"This is a three-year project we’re working on, and "
"so I’m coming out to introduce myself to the community,"
"and speak to people,"
"and I have many other colleagues that would like to come out,"
and to learn about Taylor County.
"R: This is the one from Latanamah,"

"and then he was so far away from home,"
he ended up coming back to West Palm Beach when my mom and dad were there.
R: He should’ve taken some of them stints off.
And they said I needed that.
I didn’t never think I did.
"But I have,"

"and they kept her,"
and they loved her.
And then another thing: she was bright like they were.
W: Oh.
R: And she didn’t have to go to the field to work and stuff like that.
"Well,"
"out on the Puckett Road,"
"they still call it Puckett Road,"
they had a school house out there.
And that’s where Puckett lived in his big ole big ole high house.
W: Who’s Puckett?
"R: And uh of course,"
"when they were teaching their children,"
"they let her go to the school house,"
"and then take care of them for them,"
and fix whatever food—whatever was needed.

R: Right along with them.

W: Cordelia Colson.
R: Cordelia Colson.
"This woman I told you was midwife,"
was one of her daughters.
W: Okay.
R: And it was one of her daughters that was the first teacher.
"When they said that— when England open its mouth and said that they had to give them children school,"
"and send ‘em to church,"
"well,"
they all got concerned then.
"Well,"
“Where we gon’ find somebody?
"These niggers can’t teach,"
they don’t know how to do anything.
 You know what Cordelia said?
“I’ll give you a teacher.
"She had taught her daughter Alberta to read and to write,"
do mathematics.
"Whatever they taught those children out there,"
she learned it.
"And they did hire Alberta,"
and Alberta was the first teacher in Taylor County.
W: Was she one of your teachers?
"R: No,"
"she could’ve been one of my daddy teachers,"
not me.
"I’m old,"
but I’m not that
W: Okay.
"R: Yeah,"
she could’ve been one of—and I think the Roundtrees came next.
And then they had a man named after this man who lived in the house by… uh by the Isaac Montgomery.
What was that boy name there?
"Anyway,"
his granddaddy was one of the teachers there at that time.
"S: I’m not that old,"
I don’t remember!
"R: No,"
you don’t remember.
But you do know the Nelsons.
Old man Nelson was one of the teachers.
He came in here from Monticello.

I see she’s an attorney now.
"So where did she do her first schooling,"
where did she first go to school?
"S: She went to school first at Jerkins,"
"and after the schools integrated,"
"she started uh school at the Rock Building,"
we call it.
And She was in fourth grade.
"And at that time,"
"her teacher was Missus Smith,"
White teacher.
"And of course she got into a spelling bee,"
and her dad called the words for her.
"And from that day to this one,"
she believes in prayer.
"And she prayed that she would win that spelling bee,"
and the superintendent called the words and I was at school working but her daddy went to the spelling bee.
"And Of course,"
she won.
And the children said that that the superintendent cheated for her.
W: Cheated for her?
S: Cheated for her.
Don’t you know that superintendent didn’t cheat?
"R: No,"
not if he was Mister Hart.
S: He didn’t—
R: Wasn’t it Mister Hart?
S: Yep.
R: Mister Hart wouldn’t cheat nothing.
S: He didn’t cheat.
He didn’t like us.
"We have had some ups and downs with her in the school system because from there,"
opinions were set.
R: She kept her eyes on her.
"S: And I told her from the outset,"
"whatever they can do,"
you can do it better.
And she just took that attitude and just went.
"You know Whatever they do,"
"you can do it better,"
Just-just believe that.
"I really didn’t want her to go,"
"but her daddy said well,"
"she going,"
so he went over there and register for her.
"R: He been up there in Michigan,"
where everything was integrated.
"S: So she had a rocky road,"
"and some of the Black children said that she thought she was White,"
"and some of the people said,"
"I thought she was better than them,"
"but I just told her to do what you got to do,"
"do your best,"
"I’m not taking uh badness for her,"
because I found your ability and you've got to do it.
"W: You were just proud and moving your daughter forward,"
telling her “You got to do what you got to do.

S: You got to do what you got to do.
And she had awful experiences.
"One,"
"the senior year,"
it was awful.
W: Senior year of high school?
"S: Yeah,"
it was awful!
"W: Okay,"
now was she at Jerkins?
S: She was at the White high school.
"W: Yeah,"
"you called it the Rock school,"
so—
"S: No,"
no no this was elementary school.
W: Okay 
S: The jerkin-The Taylor County High— 
"W: Taylor Country High,"
okay.
S: Is where she was when she got into all of these things.
You want to hear about them?
"W: Please,"
mmhm.
"S: Well,"
"to begin with,"
she was the only Black in the top ten graduating class.
"They fooled around and put nine children in the newspaper,"
and called them the top ten.
W: They didn’t put her picture in the newspaper?
S: They didn’t put it in there to start with. They didn't put it in there to start with. 
"W: Now what year was this,"
her senior year?
S: 76.
"W: 76,"
okay.
S: They didn’t put it in there.
"She came home with the paper,"
"her watery eyes,"
"because I told her,"
"if you think you got a problem,"
bring it home you know.
She brought the problem home.
"Went out there the next day,"
"and asked the teacher that did it,"
could she count?
You called it “top ten.
" Now,"
what do we do?
"R: You got nine,"
there.
S: I say you owe an apology to my daughter.
Okay?
You owe her an apology.
"W: Now,"
"was she number ten,"
or she was in the top ten but she was higher than number ten?
S: She was in the top ten.
"W: Okay,"
so she wasn’t necessarily number ten? She was just in the top ten? 
"S: No,"
I don’t know—
"—which number she was,"
but she was in the top ten.
"I don’t know which number,"
I don’t know whether she was number four or number—
"R: Well if you going to be top ten,"
"then your top ten go in the paper,"
instead of nine.
"W: Well she couldn’t have been number ten,"
or they probably would’ve recognized the top nine.
"So,"
"she was in the top ten,"
and she was left out.
S: They had to take another picture and put it in the paper— 
W: Well that’s good.
S: —and undo that mistake.
" and I told them it could be a racial—“No,"
"no,"
"no,"
"no,"
no!
 
R: They want to say that—
W: It was just a mistake.
S: It was just a mistake.
W: Well now that was the bicentennial.
That was the two-hundred year anniversary of the country so that was a big deal.
S: It was—yeah.
"And she and then,"
they block-voted and did the Daughters of American Revolution.
W: Mhm 
S: They did not take her up there to the meeting.
I took her to the Daughters of American Revolution meeting.
Tallahassee.
W: Was that something that was automatically conveyed upon students with a certain grade?
"S: No,"
no.
It was something that the students voted for.
W: Okay.
"S: This decided that they were going to do one of us,"
and they chose her.
"And Then when they block-voted,"
Uh she won.
It took them about a week to answer and put it on the loudspeaker who won.
They didn’t want her to be the winner!
W: Oh Okay.
Who was the principal of the school at this time?
S: I don’t even know!
I don’t even know.
She knows.
R: Doctor Hart came with them.
S: But-but-but I got to the lady’s house.
I had her address and name in my purse.
She told me there was not going to be a meeting at her house.
"I said,"
"“Oh yes,"
there is a meeting.
"This is the number that the school gave me,"
and this is the street.
There’s going to be a meeting here.
" She told me,"
"“No,"
no.
" I say,"
"I got my purse,"
"“You are Miss whatever,"
and this is the right address.
There’s a meeting here.
" “Oh yeah,"
"yeah,"

W: So you had gotten there early?
"S: Yeah,"
got there early to find it.
W: Build up some reconnaissance.
"S: Yeah,"

"So I didn’t go in the meeting,"
but I was sitting outside under the tree in my car.
"I told her,"
"if you feel anything going on wrong in there,"
"you’re twelfth grade,"
you ought to know when you’re being ill-treated.
Don’t stay in there.
"So We got back,"
"everything’s wonderful,"
"she said they were nice,"
but why?
R: She sat there under the tree.
S: Yeah I sat there under the tree.
I wasn’t going to leave my child!
Under the tree.
R: I didn’t say you did wrong.
"S: I was waiting under the tree,"
"and I was waiting for that door to open,"
"and say that somebody bothering me,"
because the lady told me there wasn’t going to be a meeting.
R: I remember all those funny things.
What about that girl that didn’t get their words straight?
S: Huh?
"R: About her words,"
she didn’t get it straight.
S: Which one?
R: Hmm?
"No it’s some kind of word by the globe,"
and it was round or something like that.
"You don’t forget that,"
that was funny.
"W: Okay Now see,"
you did not tell me you were Reverend Reaves.
I didn’t know that you were a minister.
R: Mmhm.
"S: Yeah,"
I could write you a book about the experiences.
"R: I didn’t realize that all of them down in Mississippi taught me out of Jacksonville,"
during the WPA program.
"And I didn’t think about that,"
and he gave me a certificate anyway.
"I said,"
well that might be why I made a with that art.
S: What?
R: Artwork.
S: Oh.
R: You know they stopped having the art program here in the mill?
My children went on it for a couple of years.
"And they didn't-for some reason,"
they just went out.
"Didn’t bother me,"
but they always honor the children.
They did ribbons.
But for some reason they just didn’t do them anymore.
W: What did your daughter—?
"R: Now,"
"I had a box for these one,"
"they disappeared,"
I don’t know where they went.
I want ‘em so bad you know.
S: Make some more.
"R: Yeah,"
I could give him one.
S: Make some more.
"R: Well,"
I could send them back to the house or to the big bookstore over there and get some more.
S: Okay.
R: It’s the only one I have.
S: What did you—?
W: I was about to ask you about your daughter’s education.
Where did she go to um receive her Bachelor’s degree?
S: She received her Bachelor’s degree in Pharmacy at Florida A&M Then she received a Doctorate in Pharmacology at Florida A&M
R: Where did she get the Master’s from?
"S: Then You don’t get Master’s in that program,"
you get the Doctorate.
"And then,"
"she went to Howard University,"
professor for however many years.
"Then she decided that she didn’t want to do that,"
because she was teaching men your probably your age that was older than she was.
"At this point,"
"she was liketwenty-four,"
"and um at this time also,"
"a professor had gotten shot at university at FSU because he failed to change a grade on a boy that was trying to get out so he could go to work,"
"and he ask him over and over,"
you say you’re not going to change the grade?
"And what he did was out from under his shirt,"
like you wearing now—
R: Did the man die?
S: He kill him right there!
He told him he wasn’t going to change the grade.
W: I never heard this story.
"R: Well listen here,"
what did I tell my teacher?
S: That was in the paper.
"R: I told her to give me some more work,"
didn’t I?
W: Mmhm.
R: I didn’t have time to get mad.
S: That was in the paper!
"Right up there,"
Tallahassee.
"W: Do you remember what year,"
"about,"
that might have happened?
S: I don’t remember.
"I don’t even know whether he was Black or White,"
I don’t remember that.
W: Probably early 80s since your daughter graduated high school in '76.
S: Mmhm.
"But anyway,"
"Uh uh they told her,"
you up here trying to flunk somebody and you still got milk around your mouth!
R: and She didn’t want to stay?
I thought it was too cold for her.
S: She didn’t want to stay in that profession.
"Yeah Those fellows,"
"she said they were harder,"
"they were—and she was trying to be sure that they were ready to take the National Pharmacy Exam,"
"and the Washington exams,"
"and things,"
"and she had to grade like you supposed to,"
and they wanted her to—
W: Pass them through.
"S: Kind of,"
you know...
Yeah.
R: Pad them the court.
S: You go out there and play with people health because you don’t know what you’re doing.
W: She had a responsibility to make sure they knew what they were doing.
S: Yeah.
"W: Because she’s certifying that they’re certifiable,"
"so it’s her reputation,"
really.
"S: Yes,"
it was on the line.
"So she thought,"
"“Well let me come out of here,"
" and then she moved back to Miami,"
and went to University of Miami.
W: For law school?
S: Law school.
W: Okay.
S: Jurisprudence.
W: Mmhm.
Yeah.
That’s a marvelous career.
So she’s been practicing law.
S: Yeah.
W: For twenty years.
S: Not quite twenty.
W: Not quite twenty?
S: She graduated from college in 81. She graduated again in 83 and she graduated again in about 86.
W: Okay.
Well that’s 24 years since 86.
S: Yeah.
She’s been practicing a bit.
"But at one point she was working seven days,"
and all seven in pharmacy.
"Then,"
"she used that time—her dad was sick—to fly over me and go to Quincy to see her daddy,"
and fly back to Miami.
She didn’t stop by Perry.
R: She loved her daddy so much.
S: She flew and—
W: She flew into Tallahassee and drove out to Quincy.
"S: She drove out to Quincy,"
"rented a car,"
drove to Quincy.
"Then,"
"that was in these seven days off,"
"and at that time,"
she’d do about three days with him and go back and work on law.
"Now she’s full-time law,"
"and doing-keeping her pharmacy certificate alive,"
and doing pharmacy when she get ready.
W: Mhm
"S: Yep,"
"so,"
that is what she doing now.
"W: Well,"
"I’ve enjoyed talking to you all,"
"and I hate to take it so long that you get bored with it or you know everybody gets tired,"
"so maybe this’ll be a good time for a break and you talk about me coming back again sometime,"
if um that is convenient for you all.
I’ve very much enjoyed our conversation.
But I always like to close an interview with asking the people I’m speaking with to offer some kind of reflection.
"You know maybe something you liked about the interview,"
"or something you thought we didn’t talk about,"
or just whatever your comments might be.
"And then,"
"after you make those comments,"
that’ll be the end of the interview.
"S: you know I was wondering as we talked if we were reaching what you needed,"
"and if we were supplying the kind of information you need,"
or really what were you going to do with it?
W: Did you want me to answer?
S: Yes.
"W: Okay,"
because normally I would just end at this point.
"S: What were you going to do with it,"
is the question.
"W: No,"
"I think that these answers have been very good,"
they’ve provided some very unique insight.
"I’ve never interviewed two sisters at once to talk about issues in African-American history in Florida,"
so this is a first for me to do it this way.
The purpose of the African-American History Project is to gather three hundred stories from African-Americans um on what it’s like to be Black in the south and in Florida.
"This particular part in Taylor County has some very unique resonance for me because I don’t know many other people who have studied Taylor County,"
"so my goals are just to gather information,"
"to find out as much as possible,"
"Um perhaps publish a paper one day about what we’ve talked about,"
or perhaps one day to write a book about what we’ve talked about.
But primarily to collect information for the oral history archives at the University of Florida.
So That’s the primary mission that I’m working on right now.
R: You know it’d have been nice had I let you see what all written up about from the University of Florida.
W: Oh really?
"R: Yeah,"
"well anyway,"
I’ll tell you what it’s like.
"They’re concerned about building up the waterways,"
"putting down ramps,"
"and different things,"
"and highways in Taylor County,"
and they wanted to know how I felt about it.
"Well,"
have I ever been out there doing anything?
"Well the only thing I’ve ever been out there when my husband was living,"
"I went out there and fished sometimes,"
"and we’d walk bare- feeted in the water and pick up some of them little old shrimps or crabs or something that they liked to eat,"
and go wading.
"That’s about all I’ve ever done,"
is fish.
"S: Yeah,"
"because,"
"see,"
it would take me five minutes to go and get—then I would know whether you can really use it or not or whether—what you would want to do with it.
Let me go and get this.
"W: Well Thank you very much for being willing to do that,"
"and I'm um like I said this is part of a three year project we’re doing,"
"so I hope that more than even me writing a paper,"
"or writing a book,"
"or getting something into the archives,"
"that because we’ve had these conversations,"
"that it’s interested you enough that you will let some more of my colleagues come and speak with you and find out more about what life was like,"
and maybe even introduce us to some other people in the community who you feel may be able to help us answer further questions about what’s going on.
"So,"
I look at this more of introduction.
S: Let me see if if you can perhaps use something that I got.
W: Okay.
"R: Yeah,"
"because if you bring something by the school,"
I wish I could—
"W: I would like to take some pictures of this stuff,"
I just didn’t want to stop with the interview that we were doing.
R: What you say now?
"I want to take some pictures of the yearbook,"
"and some of your certificates,"
I was just—we were in the interview.
R: It’s all right to take some of them certificates just in those books.
"W: Okay,"
"and just to close out the interview,"
this is Marna Weston with the Oral History Program.
"Today I’ve spoken with Juanita Scott Williams,"
"and with Laura Scott Reaves in Missus Reaves’ home in Perry Florida,"
"and this is Mar- pardon me May 14,"
