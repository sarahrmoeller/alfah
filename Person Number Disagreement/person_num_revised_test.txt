Even if it was to survive?	0
That's really an indictment on the area.	0
Our grandfather was custodian at Hummer-Floyd College in Eatonville, Florida.	0
And I understand that you’re talking about segregation, but I was trying to get it spoken to in your own words.	0
There was the time that, for some reason, we got in the wrong area where the United States I think was going to be bombing; we had to hurry up and get out of there.	0

and I talked, and I guess I don’t want to tell this story before I get to talking about Vietnam unless you want me to talk into it now , but I had to tell them how I lived in Vietnam.	0
It was, I believe, Huntsville, Alabama.	0
And, all week this guy would sit there with a dictionary in front of him and try to find the longest words, the hardest words he could in the dictionary, and he would learn how to spell 'em, and he would get the meaning, and he would call us down.	0

So you couldn’t see them, like we’re having this conversation.	0
Because oftentimes teachers never see the finished product; they just see what comes through their class.	0
He is going to share with me some of his personal experiences at the University of Florida, his experiences in stories told to him by his parents and grandparents about his hometown in Haiti and the comparisons of the truth and reconciliation movements to those in Haiti and here in the U.S., specifically here in Gainesville, Florida.	0
[Well it was all over you know all over the state.]	0
If you can think of a school that you remember that was the rival of the Central Academy, your team would really rise up and the school would rise up for the challenge, who were those schools; your challengers?	0
So when they went over, they said, “Well okay, we got to go to other places.”	0
So, and the thing of it too was she had fallen out , but the teachers knew she had asthma, they should look out for her.	0
[And there's a story that in Annie Roberts, who was a mid-wife delivered Black and White babies in Jefferson County and Leon County and that was my grandmother on my mother's side, so we were all attracted to science and medicine.]	0
Last year I talked to a couple of people, one of them being a politician the guy was running he said, one of the greatest exports of Taylor County is its children.	0
I was very fond of it.	0
[And he was a disabled vet.]	0
This is digital.	0
I know where that is.	0
Now, if my name was on that record, you could do something but you don't want my name on that record because you don't want to have to carry me to court and the court may give the child to me.	0
[In building leaders and seeing leadership come from this heritage of the educational base in the community, do you have a definition of leadership and what would that be?]	0
"And this little kid looked at me and goes, Your daughter is a pharmacist?"""""	0
[Talked to me about, yes because I was a child I didn't they tried to keep everything from us you know so, so we wouldn't be afraid and in fact everybody would be back in hiding when night comes.]	0
But we never told them that they had to do this or they had to do that , they just assumed since we were educators that they had to be educators too.	0
You were talking about D .C. got hit.	0
Do you remember what kind of—I mean, was it all just straight-up mathematics and arithmetic and reading or stuff, or were there other lessons, you know, like—?	0
[Now how about your mother, is she still with you?]	0
With how much surprise and accomplishment comes through struggle, as I was listening to you and reflecting on this weekend, I thought about the place that we're sitting right now, the nature of this particular park-	0
[Our class was a very class, about thirty in our class, about fifty graduated, and we was real close.]	1
It was the first store on the right hand side going into Main Street.	0
So they sent me to the Department of Social Studies to be the typist for the head.	0
[He was an attorney, yes.]	0
but I don’t remember who the postmaster was.	0
I was.	0
We wanted you to play basketball if you wanted to, volleyball if you wanted to, football if you wanted to, play a sport if you wanted to and we were getting there	0
[You might recall on the night that President Obama won the presidency, the man that came forward and apologized for hitting Congressmen John Lewis also apologized for the way he had treated Black students at a small college in South Carolina, that was Friendship Junior College, our college.]	0
I don’t think he was trying to make a man out of us , cause we was already a man.	1
And at the time we was young, never been away from home before in our lives or whatever, but we wasn’t afraid.	1
So, as I understand it, Taylor County Leadership got a grant and at that time they renovated the cafeteria, re-roofed it, and put it into the condition that you see it is today.	0
We are non- profit.	0
Ultimately my main factor for choosing any University was convenience, location, just tuition, scholarship availability.	0
[In fact we wanted to climb, and that's the thing it started at home it was reinforced at Jerkins, it was reinforced in the churches that we were attending, so it represented a community forum of everybody working to become better.]	0
But my hair was teenagery then, I always had long hair.	0
I don’t have a dishwasher	0
No it wasn’t, no there wasn’t, no there wasn’t.	0
[Helen Flowers, Verna Bishop, Thelma Bishop, and Lester Flowers.]	0
It’s a wonderful day and we are sitting in the front part of the house.	0
And my father’s favorite hymn was “Jesus Keep Me Near The Cross,” so I think that’ s why —that’s mostly what in the years, maybe in my growing up to maybe ninth grade , that’s mostly what they sang; hymns.	0
But he was a nice teacher.	0
But right here at this corner in High Springs.	0
So I said, 'He missed Monday, he missed Tuesday, he missed Wednesday.'	0
So when I was four, five, six, seven, eight years old I was thirsting for the truth.	0
Were you ever in a situation where the enemy infiltrated your lines and they were all around you?	0
[They didn't like the Baptists church because the people got very noisy, carried away, shouting out, and that kind of thing.]	0
Have you ever visited that church?	0
When we moved to Miami, Florida that was our first place we actually settled down in the United States.	0
We was taught about segregation from babies.	1
I can’t remember what it was.	0
The rest of the school will know these are the seniors.	0
It was eighty - one to ninety -one one month.	0
Their salaries was not good.	1
and so was my mom, but I tell them you, I says, “When I was coming along, if the rules and things that were like that are now the laws, there’s a lot of people would be in jail or in prison.”	1
In another part of the campus, we could have daycare.	0
We're going to use this to try and get some assistance from the local government to do some things that really need to be done for the facility.	0
That was his family.	0
What would you like to see or do you expect to see happen here this weekend?	0
[So do you have more information about the people who raised you?]	0
and so he would come to the next meeting, just tryna throw me off or make little judgement calls like you know, “why we got a Black guy here running this town.”	0
You know some classes you don’t mind if you miss?	0
Who's room, where is that?	0
Okay, one thing I learned at Lincoln when I was a teacher my first teaching job over there at Lincoln, I knew I was in school with a level of parents.	0
We was very independent.	1
I’d get me twenty five of those and that would be my lunch and because see my parents said “You’re working now?	0
It was a good thing.	0
Louise Markey talking about s	0
My whole life was sheltered really.	0
and I feel like the dynamic of worship is different.	0
The board members did pass the resolution where they gave this facility to Taylor County Leadership.	0
[So I was like between seven, seven and eight years old.]	0
[What is your definition of leadership, having been a leader in a school and now historical leader here with the class of Jerkins High School, what is leadership?]	0
That was my advanced training up at Fort Jackson.	0
As you may tell this tale, sir.	0
This was the beginning.	0
And, I still love to give because that's what her life was all about.	0
Well, short term is to waterproof the existing buildings, to add additional infrastructure capacity of the buildings, i.e. to build and renovate existing bathrooms to get the sewer system up to capacity where it can handle large functions that will happen here on campus.	0
Their main goal is to reconcile with the past wrongdoings, address them, and also make people aware of them.	0
I know earlier you talked about the education, scholarships and opportunities afforded to you, but did this ever cross your mind?	0
Now, the Westward Movement what is that?	0
But the thing about it is trying to correct them.	0
I had a teacher when I was in about the third grade.	0
[Well this is such a delightful interview, I've been instructed to kind of wrap it up with you.]	0
[When and where were you born, sir?]	0
[Well for example, you were president of your freshman class.]	0
[And so if you going through the violence, you know, that's a different way to go, but nonviolent is the best way to go.]	0
He’s the one  put is in this predicament.	0
[In fact we didn't have a our school building burned down when I was in the fifth grade, so we didn't have a school we had we went to school in churches and rented houses.]	0
[Or was going to close?]	0
I told you on the phone that I had two Purple Hearts , but they was for the same injuries.	1
[I was only four years old when I knew my grandmother and grandfather.]	0
So those two were your favorite hymns —	0
Because there weren’t any White people here to discriminate against anybody?	0
And that was another reason I wanted to leave Perry, leave the South, leave period, and go in the military	0
I guess because we were in the same territory every day, you know.	0
But they cared about people and then they had to go take the school out.	0
So did you go to Tallahassee to register?	0
The only grocery store we have now is out at Winn Dixie and I have to ride out there.	0
My mom is Marie Lafortune, my dad Michael Lafortune and by order of descending I am the oldest, Witchell Lafortune.	0
His dad name was Jack Kemp , his dad died of an accident.	0
And he was from Palatka, which he’s still living.	0
But if I had’ve been in a US —which “US” means you was drafted, “ RA” means you volunteered for three years —if I’d’ve been in for three years, I would have stood another chance when I got back stateside to come back to Vietnam again; another tour.	1
Did you hear what Petey Green was telling the people in D .C.	0
And I said to my little girl, who was two or three years old, well, about three I guess , I said, “Look, Bonnie, there goes Ms. Vaughn.	0
No, it’s on this same street.	0
Could you talk a little bit about where we are sitting?	0
And my uncle, which was his son, came up working with him and learning mechanical skills also; which , he’s deceased, that uncle.	0
Now , is that at attention ?	0
One time from disciplinary problems ever!	0
There was a violinist section and an orchestra section and a voice section.	0
Coach Turner and Mr. Ingram were doing it forty years ago.	0
I mean, were there —what I’m asking is, were there things that you didn’t do because “ you do not do those things,” were there places where you were not treated like you would’ve wanted to be treated, or did you feel that everything was pretty much okay?	0
[So, and I see a lot of them, and a lot of them expect me to come, because they contact me and let me know that they were going to be here for these three days.]	0
But you know , during that time, you don’t really feel probably what you should be feeling because of the emotions —and of course, these are your buddies and you want to get them out.	0
Jerkins was like a neighborhood school.	0
Right now we do have food distribution for the community once a month; we would like to increase that to once a week.	0
And use it for this project and for educational purposes and things like that.	0
I really was!	0
[Having spoken with only a few of the graduates but being around the excitement of last night and today, a lot of people are really happy that this is occurring.]	0
[They were from Jefferson County, in fact excuse my pride, but I must mention this two brothers married two sisters.]	0
And do you believe that your community expands far beyond, as you put it, my people specifically to elaborate for this interview African American people?	0
I would say NESBI and the Club Creole has they’ve given me that sense of community that I was lacking for a while.	0
and it was downtown at first and after a while he built the place out here—	0
Do you feel like so much of it is missing because of integration because it not that sense of community in—	0
She’s been here when Bonnie was a little ol’ thing.	0
I’m glad I was invited.	0
Well you were trying to protect her.	0
[and well I learned a lot from her because one thing I remember that I will never forget is we was at assembly and this person sat by another person and they act like they thought that they was better than that person, so they moved and she had them come back and sit down and told him not to you know think he was so much better than her you know?]	1
So hopefully this is not as clear as mud.	0
The church that I attend when I was small was New Grove Baptist Church, which was across from the farm we lived on and it was a very—very few —it was a small membership.	0
Leadership will help you establish the goal, management will help you get to the goal and maintain that goal.	0
And even though we moved all across this country, most of us come home occasionally	0
I thought the brownie was basement.	0
I wasn’t considered no big shot, just kinda I worked my way, I didn’t just in one day become a mayor.	0
[Where is Norristown located?]	0
People were quick to judge, quick to go off their prejudices.	0
I was very young.	0
It’s kind of hard to say , because these students are like maybe tenth graders .	0
But that’s the parent working with the teacher.	0
Are you enjoying your extended—we haven’t talked about your photography career yet, but I’m assuming you all spend time on what you consider kind of a semi -retirement ?	0
They was out in the wood line some where.	1
I think it was this right here.	0
[Which one were you best at?]	0
Mary Lewis.	0
Because we were all slim and trim and the kids in the neighborhood would come by to eat, and eat our food that we didn't want.	0
This is in Johnson.	0
I’m one that they cared for.	0
That this isn't just for the graduates of Jerkins High School 	0
But my parents really didn’t—they didn’t really want us to go to get part-time jobs.	0
I think merit pay is one of the most disgraceful things in the area of education.	0
So my great-grandfather was Caucasian, and my granddaddy was half.	0
Because at the time that it was given to Jerkins, that cafeteria was a welding shop with all of the hoods, the electricity outlets, the entire power stations that were needed to run a full-fledge welding shop.	0
[Because there are a lot of laws that would take our rights.]	0
But you didn't believe it was right.	0
She tried to get me to volunteer to go to school , but I was having my PTS , and I didn’t think that I could just drop my job and be able to go to school not knowing what changes it might put me through.	0
I don’t know I just like that we had to walk to somewhere, not far from the place, it was near town, to go swimming.	0
That I think helped to raise her.	0
That was the Masonic Lodge.	0
Okay well let me ask you this then.	0
[Okay, and what was Mr. Turner's philosophy about basketball?]	0
 I was supposed to stand up and I got my notebook, open my notebook it wasn't— you don't see anything here do you?	0
[You've talked about the importance, you wish that they were here to share this experience with you more, and you brought a grandson with you.]	0
My father was never college educated, but most of my education came from my father.	0
What were people doing when you heard?	0
And when she told us where geometry was in Gainesville, the buildings, they couldn’t have built the building without a knowledge of geometry.	0
When I was in Japan, it first started with me having nightmares and headaches.	0
[Did somebody come in, was there an announcement?]	0
"So it's those kinds of moments that people have with their teachers, that they go back now and say, Thank you,  doing the process wasn't that great"""	0
He had paid somebody to teach himself voice but I don’t think his pocket could afford that, so he had to stop.	0
It is September 9th, 2011.	0
So after tagging me and putting me on this plane, this Chinook , we opened up the back doorway to drive a jeep in there, but they had places where you—place you could sit, and also had like where they could put stretchers for guys that was really messed up so bad that they could not sit.	1
And my sister took piano.	0
He made us believe that your character was one of the most important elements of your being and that character was more important than any credential you could have on your wall.	0
I felt something cold , and I was out like a light.	0
And another thing, too, my birthday was — and they changed school a lot since I was little.	0
[I met the person at a dance, he was a Norristown person right.]	0
[What was his name?]	0
But I also had a grandmother that was very instrumental in me following into local politics -	0
So that night after that the guys that was really messed up real bad, the medevac came in and it was like cut off trees there.	1
and then the background was pretty trees.	0
So when and where were you born?	0
It was important in the where it was a privilege	0
Of course, no medication helped the nightmares.	0
I have three kids —one by first marriage; Cassandra Clayton and Cornelius Frederick Clayton, which he is in the military; my daughter lives in Gainesville; and one offspring by ex-girlfriend that’s thirty-three.	0
There was separation.	0
[It's what we were reared on.]	0
Now, in a Black school I have had teachers who I thought was really out of this world at being good.	1
[What does that mean for the kids that are here, if the people who have success and were tied of the community in the past and their parents and the best and brightest don't want to come back here?]	0
Because that's what I drove all this way for I wanted to see-	0
So, once that was done there became some legal issues that I'm not totally versed in what happened with the Taylor County Improvement Club and it dissolved until the Taylor County Leadership grew out of that with some of the members.	0
She had this little model eight coupe that had a rumble seat, you know what that is?	0
At one time it was a very vibrant community.	0
So do you know anything specifically about what caused the truth commission to come about?	0
[Nelson was 72, 72; two years older than myself.]	0
That was over at A. Quinn Jones School now.	0
They kinda told us what was going on out in the field and stuff.	0
She was Ms. Thomson then, but they lived up there first and she had boarders.	0
They don’t want to pay you like they pay some of the others and they want to say that you are inferior but when it boils down from the standpoint of learning there’s a difference there.	0
Just saying, any other brothers and sisters.	0
But the option for University of Florida really stood out because one, the education level and the education they provide, which was really important for me and my parents, just at the University of Florida is held to a standard and it’s known for providing quality education.	0
Now, two children, what were their names?	0
And then that’s when you really hit you that you was not equal or things was not the same.	1
No, it didn’t —we were young, and there was a lot of problems, mother in law problems, stuff.	1
[Yes down there teaching chemistry, right down the hall.]	0
[Now, the best you can might not be making all As or all Bs, the best you can might be a C, but they made us feel as proud about a good C well-earned and made us proud about ourselves as long as we were doing our best and giving our all.]	0
Do you have brothers and sisters?	0
But she picked out what food, made sure everything was balanced, and 	0
[And I am speaking with Mr. Dennis who is a member of the school board and also a Jerkins High School graduate.]	0
[So, it was a in that first year, we had riots, riots, riots, and conflicts, conflicts, commotion.]	0
[We shared with one another, and we was concerned about one another]	1
And I went through a lot, because I was denied the medical at the time.	0
We are behind the quarters.	0
He was with the railroad.	0
[Episcopal, Episcopalians.]	0
My name is Cornelius Clayton Jr., and it’s C-	0
And some of the parents got involved in that.	0
Well, I think as most African American high schools within this state and even within the nation, the high school was always the central collecting point for all of the African American citizens within that community.	0
I know we’ll have at least one more, and maybe several , but on behalf of the Sam Proctor Oral History Program, and our African American History Project , I want to thank you for taking the time to drive in from Melrose and come in our studio and talk to us.	0
See him in his uniform either with his cap off or on.	0
And I think this is a way I try to, the next day, sometime I remember it, sometime I don’t.	0
[There was HEW and the county had a suit against HEW]	0
So we don’t see back when I was there	0
What was her name?	0
So, that was there.	0
I don’t know too much about my paternal grandparents.	0
If it was—I believe that was, I think that’s about where it was.	0
and I guess Idella helped her, wash our clothes, our dresses and things.	0
Two back-to-back Black Florida high school state football champions, outstanding achievements in the classroom compared to the local school that was not Black, as well.	0
The Presbyterian Church was just down the street , the old Presbyterian Church, with beautiful, stained windows —All round windows in the sun .	0
So we’ll take a five-ish minute break.	0
The origins of Black people, they come from what you call the Land of Canaan and they were the descendants of the ancient Israelites.	0
So, we appreciate you taking the time to visit with us and to listen to us and to talk to some of my crazy classmates I know those guys.	0
The question was asked about Afro- Americans migrating back to Africa.	0
I'm Anna Brodrecht from the Oral History Program at the University of Florida.	0
When I finished school , and I finished school in 1966, and the jobs that was very—you didn’t really have to have an education to go in and work.	1
Because I could imagine there were days that you felt, “Why did I have to be Black?”	0
You can tell that ; I’m always interested in where people were when important events happened.	0
And Ms. Roundtree was one of the best, and I’m telling you, and my third grade teacher Ms. Martin.	0
I guess it goes back to that old saying, was, give a man a fish, feed him for a day.	0
I’ve learned so much, and I’m glad you were able to sit down with me and talk to me about this part of your life, so I really appreciate you.	0
We even had a feed store downtown and that was Mr. and Mrs. Lindsey and their daughter married who became later vice principal out at Santa Fe, Everett, was the name.	0
It is.	0
[Who were your mom and dad?]	0
Well actually, I didn’t really listen to the news that much, and I really wasn’t into politics , so I really don’t know a whole lot, you know, about Johnson.	0
Or, what were their names and where were they located?	0
Well, I was working at Shands.	0
Somewhere to go to but we are not, so we still not free.	0
What’s his name?	0
Like, why was it so important?	0
Now you were in the services as well.	0
[I think we got to realize that you can make a living here like I made a good living here and a bunch of my brothers are still here that made a good living.]	0
[Paralyzed in one side, and was in a chair.]	0
Particularly they would recognize outstanding students for whatever they might of benefitted to the school like some was good in band.	1
The other two ladies are deceased, but Robert Allen, he is still living because he got out of college early, so he was probably teaching us when he was probably like twenty -two.	0
[Prison like a Black university.]	0
Just because, I don’t know after going through a lot my childhood was a growing process.	0
[We were in front of FW Woolworth's store.]	0
People walk by there a lot, and his wife would stay down there with him a lot.	0
I said , “When the teacher brought that in to me, I thought that was the Real McCoy, and she thought it was too and a member of the class thought it was .	0
No, I wasn’t fixing to go out into it—no, no, that was during Vietnam.	0
His name was Ernest Magali Jr.	0
Even while I was applying I knew there were some of them that I applied to that I would never go to because it wasn’t convenient for and it wouldn’t be convenient for me.	0
"So she got so frustrated with him and said, Look, this is it."""	0
And it gave me an opportunity to actually go over and to actually see some of the countries that we were talking about here in school.	0
He was from Waycross, Georgia.	0
Well, there were several who were really good friends and when you lived this close together and you trade with them and you speak to them all the time— now it isn’t like that.	0
So many people talk about Lincoln with such fond memories, was it something special about Lincoln that captured your heart as well especially since you went back?	0
[And he was an attorney?]	0
[Well it is exciting because of—this place was a landmark that gave us a sense of pride as a Black community and because of that I just feel like we need to try to keep that heritage going.]	0
[Why is that?]	0
But could you go back and describe what it was like to go to school in the places where you went?	0
You were trained to do the mortars?	0
[Okay and you were in the glee club?]	0
It took me months to figure it out but when I did figure it out, what I realized was that there may not be a lot of my people here at UF, but it’s really they are!	0
In fact, one of the gentlemen, Mr. Ingram, was a barber.	0
What did they see that they had no idea was there?	0
I had three grandmothers, he was married three times back in the day.	0
and I became commission officer, I didn’t see men of color.	0
I know you talked about your grandma telling you stories about this, but there are other stories in relation to the truth commissions that she told you in regards to government or the livelihood within that economy?	0
[Now, we've had kind of some sad statistics inside too.]	0
So this is the main reason why we in this country and we struggling right on now.	0
[And this here is a historical marker today, and I'm glad to participate in what's going on here today to show my grandboy just where we started out here, and things like that.]	0
Which means it needs to be totally refurbished and between now and then our hope is to try to come up with a budget, challenge our people to raise those funds and then let's do it, let's build it, let's establish this.	0
[Yes, that was her husband.]	0
So I was trying to make sure that we take care of those families that couldn’t afford wanted quality service, wanna make sure we had quality water.	0
From Homer Smith, which was one of our first professors from way back.	0
So she said , “His daddy won’t know about it?”	0
It doesn’t have the intrigue, the humanity, and the— what are some more good adjectives?	0
Yes, yea, the culture in Alabama was definitely different.	0
[It was argued before the United States Supreme Court, the Taylor County School Board won and all eleven Southern states got their monies back.]	0
She worked at home but it was a nice thing to go to her home and get our china and silver when we got married.	0
Well she graduated, she is now in North Carolina as a pharmacist.	0
Yes it is.	0
I watched from the way they dressed, how they spoke, their mannerisms, what they taught, the things that they taught us that we would encounter when we became adults, is still with me today.	1
You know where A. Quinn Jones is?	0
You indicated you were the vice president of the student council that year -	0
You know, all up in Melrose, the paraded up in Melrose, and this and that.	0
And I said this in a seminar that I was doing.	0
And they still considered that I was married and had two kids , but during that time the war was going on.	0
They was in the wood line.	1
The reason why I had this done, like a brother of mine named, he come from Quincy, named John Hughes and he showed me a family reunion where the slave master had about four or five hundred slaves and	0
So you would say you often interacted with Whites, and what were those interactions like if you did ?	0
What do you believe the overlying importance of these truth commissions are?	0
Oh Lord, I’m telling you I don’t know the half of what went on in this town.	0
[And he was not a good candidate for marriage.]	0
And looking over it all, it was worth while having.	0
But I was blessed, because I played basketball.	0
Now, was this , or you volunteered to go?	0
Okay , so since we was in the crater sitting up there waiting, just take a break before we dig in, they opened up.	1
[Well it was a surprise, but I enjoyed it and thank you for interviewing me.]	0
If it he had of been a lady I could have jumped up in his arm and kissed him like it didn’t even touch me , because I was afraid if I went back for three and a half months , the way things was going for the United States , that I might of not have made it back.	1
Six months later, in October of 69, I actually got honorable discharge from the reserve, and went actually into the Air Force.	0
So he would come back and he apologized, for his actions .	0
What were you doing there?	0
But it was a work day .	0
So it is a very used park and they have gorgeous trees and stuff here.	0
Long term, we see this facility as being a campus for social service activities from the adult to a preschool.	0
It was more orientation, I guess, about probably what to expect going over there and telling us about the country.	0
Yes, I’ve heard instances where truth commissions were established in Haiti.	0
It’s best just not to talk and spread something that — you weren’t there how do you know	0
You mentioned you attended University of Florida and was also- you played football there.	0
The looked at me almost like I was a ghost , because they couldn’t believe.	0
Like Jerry Lewis say “Great Ball of Fire.”	1
[It wasn't no sense in fighting; just join in and get an education.]	0
They went to the school board and they protested the school board and one of the school board members, Reverend Kenny Dennis, made the motion and there was a lot of background lobbying and course going along with the other board members.	0
It was like a country store.	0
Was it white, was it red, was it green?	0
The lady Ms. Milton, Liz Milton, she teach history , and they were studying about the Vietnam War.	1
It was her.	0
My parents was Jared and Irene Griffin.	1
And what’s his name?	0
And at the time when he was teaching that to all of us, I didn’t really think it was necessary for us to have that added on in physical ed, but I after I went into the military, then I saw where it was very, very useful to me and an asset to my becoming an officer.	0
